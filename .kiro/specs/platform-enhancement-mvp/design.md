# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture for enhancing the existing platform across six functional areas: workflows/orchestration, marketing suite, analytics/reporting, compliance/QMS, integrations/security, and onboarding/knowledge management. The enhancement builds upon the existing Convex-based architecture with React frontend, extending current capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

The design follows a modular approach with feature flags for controlled rollout, leveraging existing authentication, role-based permissions, and audit logging infrastructure. Each functional area is designed as a self-contained module that can be developed and deployed independently.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The platform follows a modern full-stack architecture:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using existing UI components (shadcn/ui)
- **Backend**: Convex serverless functions with real-time subscriptions
- **Database**: Convex document database with existing schema extensions
- **Authentication**: Existing auth system with role-based permissions
- **Background Jobs**: Convex scheduled functions for exports, reports, and notifications
- **Feature Management**: Feature flags for controlled rollout

```

### Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: Existing user authentication system
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with business-level permissions
- **Audit Trail**: All state changes logged to existing audit system
- **Data Encryption**: OAuth tokens encrypted at rest
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting and notification throttling
