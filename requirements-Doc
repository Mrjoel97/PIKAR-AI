Pikar AI – Enhanced Product Requirements Document
Executive Summary
Pikar AI is an AI-driven platform aiming to empower businesses of all sizes – from solopreneurs to large enterprises – by automating marketing, sales, and operations. Recent surveys show SMBs are rapidly adopting AI: 68% now use AI regularly and 74% report higher productivity. Leading small-business tools emphasize unified CRM and process automation to break down data silos and streamline workflow. However, many owners still struggle with limited time and resources and ineffective marketing: 73% lack confidence in their marketing strategy and devote an hour or less per day to it. To address these real-world pain points, we propose refining Pikar’s existing agents and workflows and adding new modules so the platform truly supports any business’s needs, from creative content to cash flow management.
Market Needs & User Pain Points
Based on industry research and user interviews, small-business and entrepreneurial users face recurring challenges:
•	Limited Time & Overload: SMB owners wear many hats. They juggle strategy, customer support, admin, etc., often doing “everything themselves”. This means important tasks fall through cracks. Automation of routine tasks (data entry, scheduling, reporting) is therefore critical 
•	Resource Constraints: Tight budgets force owners to do it all with minimal staff. 73% of SMBs feel overwhelmed by marketing tasks and 52% regularly delay or under-invest in marketingSolutions must deliver high ROI with minimal effort, e.g. AI-generated content and automated campaigns to save time. 
•	Marketing Execution & Creativity: Small businesses struggle with what and how to market: finding new content ideas, keeping up with trends, and personalizing outreach. Only 1 in 3 marketers have a scalable content strategy, and 67% of SMBs use AI for content. Pikar should thus include tools for AI-driven ideation, content repurposing, and multi-channel scheduling, helping users continuously engage audiences without hiring large teams.
•	Alignment to Goals: Many owners lack confidence in their strategy. For example, 60% cite customer acquisition as their top challenge. Pikar must help align marketing actions to business KPIs via goal-setting tools, performance dashboards, and intelligent recommendations (e.g. “run more lead-gen campaigns” when acquisition lags).
•	Data Fragmentation: Data silos (unintegrated CRM, finance, analytics) are a common pain. Integrated platforms give teams “a single version of truth” and remove blind spots. Pikar should unify customer, campaign, sales, and financial data so all agents can leverage the same insights (avoiding the “communication breakdowns” seen in siloed systems).
•	Compliance and Quality: Small businesses face increasing regulatory demands (e.g. financial audits, data privacy). For example, 87% of organizations suffer from poor compliance strategies. Pikar’s QMS already helps, but must extend to industry-specific laws (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) and provide automated audit trails, risk alerts, and CAPA workflows to simplify compliance.
•	Financial Management: Cash flow issues frequently threaten SMB survival. Owners need forecasting, expense tracking, and invoice automation. Pikar should integrate or build lightweight accounting features (budgeting, invoicing, payment reminders) so users never run out of funds due to oversight.
•	Inventory & Operations: For businesses selling products, 50% report inventory visibility gaps. Pikar must accommodate retailers and manufacturers by adding inventory and supply-chain monitoring – e.g. stock level dashboards, automated reorder alerts, and vendor management – to avoid stockouts. For service businesses, automated scheduling and billing is essential (synchronizing appointments, hours, and invoices in one workflow).
•	Team & Collaboration: Many SMBs lack specialized staff. Pikar’s platform should support collaboration (Slack/Microsoft Teams integration, shared workflows) so teams (even a small team) can assign tasks, share AI agents, and chat in context. Slack analysis shows integrations can automate onboarding, approvals, meeting follow-ups and more; Pikar can offer similar workflow triggers across its own interface and popular communication tools.
•	Tech Adoption Curve: 71% of businesses are worried that tech changes are outpacing their ability to adapt. Pikar must be highly usable and include in-app guidance (KnowledgeHub articles, tooltips, training paths) so users can learn new features easily. Continuous learning components should adapt (e.g. context-sensitive help and examples).
Target User Profiles
We refine Pikar’s user personas and journeys based on these needs:
•	Solopreneur (Tier 1): A one-person business (e.g. consultant, freelancer). Needs prebuilt templates, simplified UI, and most tasks automated (content generation, social scheduling, basic analytics). Key goals: quick wins, simple onboarding, time saving. Journey: sign up → complete guided “Discovery” in TransformationHub → run one-click marketing campaign (e.g. schedule posts and send newsletter) → view simple performance cards.
•	Startup (Tier 2): A small team seeking growth. Priorities: collaboration (invite teammates), A/B testing, CRM integration for sales, and iterative improvements. Journey: after onboarding, create strategic Initiative (e.g. “Launch new product”), orchestrate a workflow (content creation → multi-platform ads → analyze results), collaborate via shared dashboards, iterate with DTFL framework. Features: team roles, real-time collaboration widgets, integration with sales tools (CRM), pipeline analysis.
•	SME (Tier 3): Multi-department business. Focus: multi-brand management, governance, and compliance. Needs advanced approvals (tier-gated workflows), custom branding, enterprise analytics, and full QMS. Journey: admin sets up org, integrates accounting system, creates workflows across teams (e.g. marketing + sales + operations), enforces CAPA processes and audit logs. Use advanced reporting to satisfy stakeholders.
•	Enterprise (Tier 4): Large org with strict controls. Emphasize granular RBAC, SSO, audit exports, feature flags, and developer APIs. Journey: onboarding by IT team (Admin Console), custom domain agents, orchestrating large initiatives across regions, continuous compliance checks (via ComplianceRisk agent), and exporting audit trails.
Across all tiers, Pikar must remain industry-agnostic: its UI and agents should be configurable for retail, services, manufacturing, etc. For example, provide industry-specific templates in the Workflow library (e.g. “E-commerce holiday sale campaign”, “Healthcare compliance rollout”, “Restaurant reservation drip campaign”). Integrations with sector tools (e.g. Shopify for retail inventory, Epic EMR for healthcare) would further ensure Pikar fits any business.
Enhanced Architecture & Integrations
•	Unified Data Platform: Consolidate all data (contacts, financials, campaigns) in a single repository. Integrate with CRM systems or include a built-in CRM layer. This means every agent and dashboard pulls from shared data, eliminating silos and enabling cross-domain insights.
•	Integration Hub: Build connectors for popular tools: accounting (QuickBooks, Xero), CRM (Salesforce, Zoho), e-commerce (Shopify, WooCommerce), HR systems, cloud storage, email providers, and social APIs. For instance, sync customer and transaction data to fuel AI predictions. Leverage the existing integrations page to set these up easily.
•	Collaboration Channels: Offer built-in links to Slack/Teams and email. For example, post NotificationCenter alerts in Slack channels (like workflow status or campaign performance) to meet teams where they are. Use Slack-like workflow builders to trigger Pikar automations (e.g. posting a keyword triggers Pikar to start a campaign).
•	Security & SSO: Support SAML/OAuth for SSO. Offer tenant isolation and data encryption. Given high cyber risk (73% of SMBs hit by attacks), include 2FA, role-based access, and thorough audit logs across all modules.
AI Agents (Enhanced)
Pikar’s 10 AI agents cover key domains. We refine their capabilities and consider new ones:
•	Strategic Planning Agent: Already does SWOT/PESTEL. Enhance with business model canvas creation, OKR tracking, and scenario simulations. Integrate market data feeds for real-time competitor and trend analysis. The agent should generate a rough business plan outline and quarterly roadmap, not just static analysis.
•	Content Creation Agent: Support multi-format and SEO-optimized content. Add multi-language translation and localization. Enable voice and video script generation (e.g. blog-to-video). Provide brand consistency checks and asset management. Offer templates for newsletters, social posts, blog ideas (contextual to industry). With 67% of SMBs using AI for content, ensure this agent supports repurposing (e.g. turn a blog into slides or images).
•	Customer Support Agent: Extend beyond basic chat: handle omnichannel support (email, chat widgets, social DMs). Integrate with a knowledge base for self-service and use sentiment analysis to prioritize tickets. Implement escalation workflows (e.g. if frustration detected, create a high-priority follow-up). Sync with Social Media Marketing so that comments/reviews can generate tickets. This aligns with marketers saying social is now a main support channel (78% of marketers report consumers prefer social for service).
•	Sales Intelligence Agent: Deepen CRM integration. Support lead scoring using behavioral data, forecast pipeline using AI, and suggest next actions (email templates, meeting slots). Include a “Deal Dashboard” for tracking active opportunities and progress to targets. Offer automated follow-up reminders (email or via integration). If missing, add E-commerce upsell suggestions for retailers, and contract generation support.
•	Data Analysis Agent: Build advanced analytics and predictive models. Add auto-generated visualizations and anomaly alerts. For example, when a campaign underperforms, highlight why (via root-cause analysis). Use AI to auto-generate insights (like a BI tool). Support custom data connectors (CSV/SQL) so users can import any dataset. Employ ML for trend analysis and forecasting across marketing, sales, finance metrics.
•	Marketing Automation Agent: Go beyond social and ads. Include email drip-campaign orchestration, SEO keyword planning, and personalized SMS. Automate lead nurturing workflows triggered by events (e.g. new sign-up → run nurture sequence). Integrate A/B testing across channels (not just static tests) and optimize budgets dynamically. Leverage the orchestration engine to schedule content at optimal times. Provide industry playbooks (from TemplateGallery) for common campaigns.
•	Financial Analysis Agent: Not just forecasting and ROI, but cash flow modeling and expense categorization. Integrate with accounting data (bank feeds) to track cash runway. Add scenario planning (what if sales drop 20%). Automate invoice and billing reminders. Flag risks (e.g. overdue receivables, low bank balance) and suggest actions (like applying for a line of credit). Use AI for fraud/anomaly detection in expenses.
•	HR & Recruitment Agent: Expand to full HR lifecycle: candidate outreach (auto-send interview invites), interview scheduling (sync calendars), and post-hire onboarding tasks. Include performance reviews and training suggestions, linking to LearningPath. Track employee certifications and automate reminders for renewals. For larger orgs, handle org charts and resource planning.
•	Compliance & Risk Agent: Enhance regulatory coverage: enable checklist templates for GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS etc. Offer automated monitoring of regulatory updates (e.g. new tax code). Integrate cybersecurity scans (e.g. vulnerability scanning alerts tied to ComplianceAudit). Provide incident management workflows: when a security incident is flagged, auto-trigger a CAPA or risk reassessment. Maintain a risk registry and auto-update dashboards if new risks emerge.
•	Operations Optimization Agent: Beyond process mapping, add IoT and resource monitoring for industries that have equipment or facilities. For example, dashboards for store inventory levels or factory throughput. Automate maintenance schedules and supplier reorder tasks. Use process mining to suggest workflow improvements. For services, integrate scheduling (as Acumatica suggests) so that appointment booking and billing tie into workflows.
•	(New) Community/Engagement Agent: Given the rise of UGC and reviews, a new agent could curate and analyze social proof. This agent would scan reviews and social tags to generate marketing content and customer insights. It could also help manage an affiliate/influencer program (identifying key advocates and automating outreach).
•	(New) Productivity Agent: An agent to help with daily operations: managing to-do lists, prioritizing tasks with SNAP logic, syncing with calendars, and coordinating hand-offs between agents. It would use the SNAP framework to suggest what to do next each day.
All agents should integrate with Orchestrate: any agent’s output (e.g. a generated article) can be an input step in a larger workflow. Agents must respect MMR (human/AI blending) – e.g. flag content for human review in heavily regulated contexts.
Orchestration & Workflows
Pikar’s orchestration engine (Orchestrate/Workflows) should evolve to support more complex, value-driven flows:
•	Flexible Triggers: Workflows can start on user action, schedule, or external events (e.g. new lead, social spike). For example, an inventory workflow could trigger when stock is low, or a compliance workflow when a new regulation is published.
•	Conditional Branching: Enable IF/ELSE branches in workflows (e.g. if email open rate < 10%, trigger a re-send or escalate to sales outreach). MMR implies human approvals at branch points (e.g. “Send for Approval” step with TierGate).
•	Templates & Copy Workflows: Provide a global Template Gallery with pre-made workflows (industry-specific e.g. e-commerce launch, SaaS case study series) that users can copy and customize. SMEs could share community templates.
•	Human-in-the-Loop: In each workflow, allow customizable approval gates. For critical tasks (especially in higher tiers), users can require manager review before execution – aligning with Quality Management norms.
•	Cross-Agent Collaboration: A workflow might involve multiple agents. E.g. Strategy → Content Agent → Marketing Agent → Data Agent in sequence. The system should smoothly pass outputs (like a generated plan or content piece) from one agent to the next task.
•	AI-Suggested Workflows: Based on the Diagnostic Engine (see below), the system could recommend workflow templates or agent runs. For example, if the diagnostic finds low engagement, Pikar might suggest “Run a Social Campaign workflow targeting engagement.”
•	Workflow Analytics: After execution, provide a summary of results per workflow (response rates, ROI, completion status). Store execution logs for reporting and future re-use (“dry run” mode to test a workflow on sample data).
Knowledge & Learning
Embed continuous learning throughout:
•	Contextual Help: In each module, display relevant tips (Design Thinking prompts, SNAP guides) at just the right time. For instance, in the Planning phase, prompt users to apply DTFL questions; during scheduling, show best practices.
•	KnowledgeHub & Learning Paths: Expand with interactive tutorials that guide users through Pikar features (e.g. “Build your first email campaign” path). Use the KnowledgeSelector to pull articles into chats or steps automatically (e.g. a popup explaining GDPR when uploading customer data).
•	Community & Support: Consider forums or chat support where users can ask experts or peers. Link this to CollaborationHub.
•	Gamification: For onboarding, incorporate progress tracking (e.g. “Completed 3 of 5 guided tasks in Discovery”). Offer badges for usage milestones (e.g. first campaign launched, first workflow automated).
•	AI Assistance: Embed an “AI Guide” assistant (chat-based) trained on Pikar docs that can answer user questions about using features. It could also coach users (e.g. “Your new campaign has low open rate, consider adjusting subject lines”).
Core Strategic Frameworks
Continue enforcing Pikar’s guiding principles and consider adding more strategic tools:
•	ISO 9001/QMS: Strengthen CAPA by linking issues from any process (e.g. an A/B test fails) to a corrective action. Automate reminders for document reviews and compliance audits. Ensure audit logs cover all agent and admin activities.
•	MMR (Mean Mixing Ratio): Provide an interactive MMR calculator to help users decide human review thresholds per task. For example, require 100% review for sensitive content, but allow 80% AI autonomy for blog drafts. Track actual human vs AI time spent to optimize productivity.
•	Design Thinking Feedback Loop (DTFL): Embed this cycle explicitly in Initiative phases. At the end of each phase (Discovery, Planning, etc.), prompt users to gather feedback and iterate. Possibly integrate survey/feedback tools to validate ideas with real customers.
•	SNAP Prioritization: Build a daily task list in each dashboard guided by SNAP. It would sense incoming data (sales, tasks due), normalize priorities (by business impact), act by highlighting top tasks, and let the user reprioritize. This drives daily routines (e.g. morning tasks, weekly planning) based on AI signals.
•	Objective/KPI Alignment: Include an OKR module: users set high-level objectives, and Pikar suggests and tracks related tasks/metrics from the system. For example, an objective “Increase online sales 20%” ties to targets on MarketingAnalytics and SalesIntelligence.
Tier-Specific Enhancements
Pikar’s tiered dashboards and features should further distinguish user levels:
•	Solopreneur: Emphasize guided experiences and simplicity. Offer “Quick Start” wizards that automatically generate a basic plan and campaign with one click. Provide essential analytics (funnel, lead gen) with easy explanations. Keep interface uncluttered.
•	Startup: Provide team collaboration: multiple seats, shared calendars, and simple project management. Add pipeline views (Kanban) and support for A/B test experiments. Include checklists for growth hacking strategies.
•	SME: Focus on governance. Enable multi-brand or multi-location management (e.g. separate content calendars per brand). Enhance approval controls and SLA tracking in Orchestrate. Provide compliance widgets on dashboards (e.g. “Last QMS audit: 2 months ago”).
•	Enterprise: Add enterprise modules: detailed RBAC (fine-grained permissions beyond TierGate), SSO integration, feature flags (to test new Pikar features), and advanced audit exports (CSV/PDF of all logs). Possibly an API developer portal for custom extensions.
Each tier should also have curated workflow and content templates relevant to their scale. For instance, solopreneurs see “Easy 5-step social media plan”, while enterprises see “Global product launch workflow with regional tasks”.
Initiative Journey Enhancements
Pikar’s 6-phase initiative journey (Discovery through Sustainability) can be enriched:
•	Phase 0 – Onboarding: Before Discovery, a one-time guided setup: define industry, business model, key goals (uses the Diagnostic Engine) and integrate basic accounts (social, email, e-commerce, finance) to tailor the experience.
•	Discovery (Phase 1): Use AI to analyze any existing data (website visitors, social engagement) and suggest focus areas. Provide survey or quiz to clarify target customers and needs. Link findings to Strategy Agent to refine SWOT.
•	Planning & Design (Phase 2): Auto-generate a draft strategy document from Discovery outputs. Offer collaborative whiteboard tools (e.g. mind mapping for ideation). Embed DTFL checkpoints (e.g. prototype plan and test assumptions via mini-surveys or social polls).
•	Foundation (Phase 3): Ensure baseline setups: e.g. create social accounts, configure email domain, upload brand assets. Auto-check social API readiness (existing), but also check other connections (CRM, payment gateway). Possibly add a SEO readiness checklist for websites.
•	Execution (Phase 4): Leverage Orchestrate fully. Provide a live Gantt or timeline view of ongoing campaigns and tasks. Add kanban/task board integration to assign tasks to team members. Provide real-time status (e.g. “Step 3 of Social Campaign running”).
•	Scale (Phase 5): Introduce multi-channel scalability: e.g. duplicate successful campaign for new markets, translate content, increase budget. Provide “network effect” simulations (predict impact of scaling X%.
•	Sustainability (Phase 6): Focus on continuous improvement: track metrics over time, schedule regular QMS audits, and feed back insights (using DTFL) into new initiatives. Recommend lessons learned in KnowledgeHub for future projects.
Across phases, embedded calculators and frameworks should appear contextually (e.g. SNAP scoring in Planning, MMR calculator during campaign approval). All phase progress and compliance tasks feed into TransformationHub for clear visibility.
Quality, Compliance & Security
Pikar’s QMS and compliance suite should be broadened:
•	ISO/Quality Management: Automate SOP and policy version control. For any business process initiated, prompt uploading or updating the related SOP in DocumentUploadForm. Track nonconformities (e.g. low-performing campaign flagged in analytics triggers CorrectiveActionForm).
•	Incident & Risk Management: When an incident is logged (via ComplianceAudit), automatically generate a CAPA workflow. Maintain a Risk Registry where identified risks (cyber, financial, reputational) are cataloged and scored. Provide dashboards to monitor risk mitigation progress.
•	Automated Compliance Checks: For example, scan marketing emails/campaigns for GDPR compliance (opt-in checks), or scan content for regulated keywords (e.g. “FDA-approved”) using AI to flag potential issues.
•	Governance Dashboards: Add compliance KPIs to dashboards per tier (e.g. percentage of employees trained, policy review status). Track internal audit schedules and results.
•	Audit Trails: Ensure every action (agent run, user login, data change) is logged for traceability. Exportable logs should feed into AdminAudit and Reporting. This supports both ISO and legal audit requirements.
AI-Marketing Suite Upgrades
Building on the existing suite:
•	Email Marketing: Integrate an email campaign builder and automations. Use AI to generate email copy and subject lines. Include list management (segment contacts) and open-rate tracking. Sync leads and contacts from CRM into Pikar for nurture campaigns.
•	SEO & Content: Add keyword research tools and website audits. For each content created, suggest SEO optimizations (meta tags, readability). Provide a content calendar view and auto-publish to CMS platforms.
•	Ad Managers: In addition to social ads, support other channels: Google Ads, LinkedIn/Snap/Youtube, possibly native ads networks. Offer bulk editing and performance comparison. Suggest budget reallocation based on real-time ROI.
•	Social Content Tools: Support user-generated content campaigns by integrating UGC feeds. Provide built-in image/video creation or editing (leveraging AI image generators). Offer a social listening module to spot brand mentions.
•	Multi-Touch Attribution: In MarketingAnalytics, implement multi-touch attribution models to show how different channels contribute to conversions. Use AI to refine models as more data accumulates.
•	Best Practices Library: Within Marketing Suite, include industry benchmarks (e.g. average email open rates by sector) so users can compare performance.
Automated Workflows (Expanded)
Extend global and industry-specific workflows:
•	Dynamic Workflows: Allow runtime parameterization (e.g. adjusting campaign language per region). Provide a “dry run” simulation mode showing expected outcomes.
•	Templates for Every Need: In addition to the TemplateGallery, users can define custom workflow blueprints (favorite sequences) and share them. For example, a restaurant owner can create a “booking reminder → follow-up email” workflow as a reusable template.
•	Integration Triggers: Support webhooks so external apps (e.g. payment received, form submitted) can start Pikar workflows.
•	Collaboration Workflows: Automate team coordination: e.g. if a campaign fails, assign review tasks to team members. Connect with external tools via Zapier-like integrations.
•	Regulatory Workflows: Industry-specific flows, such as for healthcare (HIPAA compliance checks before publishing patient data) or finance (audit trail generation before releasing financial reports).
Custom Agent Framework
Enhance the Custom Agents feature:
•	Agent Marketplace: Allow users to browse or share user-created agents (with vetting). Include tagging for industry/usage.
•	Agent Templates: Provide templates for common custom agent types (e.g. “Twitter account manager” or “Inventory notifier”).
•	Graphical Builder: Improve the CreateAgent wizard to visualize agent logic (inputs, workflow hooks, outputs).
•	Version Control: Maintain versions of custom agents with changelogs. Allow rolling back to prior versions if needed.
•	Permissions & Approval: Restrict who can create/edit agents based on role. Agents affecting core data (e.g. auto-deleting records) require higher-tier approval.
•	Testing & Monitoring: Show usage stats per custom agent (how often run, success rates). Provide feedback loops (ratings, logs) so users can refine them.
•	OpenAI GPT Integration: (Future) Allow writing agent behavior in natural language and have Pikar generate the agent configuration, making it easier to create complex agents.
Knowledge & Learning (Enhanced)
•	Learning Paths: Offer guided courses on business topics (e.g. “Intro to Digital Marketing”, “Data-Driven Decisions”) within LearningHub. Tie completions to role development (HR agent can track training).
•	Interactive Diagnostic: When a user runs diagnostics, accompany results with recommended readings or tutorials in KnowledgeHub to address gaps (e.g. “Learn how to track KPIs” if low in that area).
•	AI Assistant: A chat-based help assistant (like a CoPilot) that answers questions about using Pikar or general business advice (leveraging built-in KnowledgeHub content and internet search).
•	Feedback & Evolution: After each initiative, prompt users to give feedback on agent outputs (like rating content quality). Use this to refine future models and agent behavior.
Analytics & Reporting
Pikar’s analytics should become more predictive and comprehensive:
•	AI-Powered Insights: Automatically generate reports (“Campaign X exceeded goals by 20% because of video ads”, “Week-over-week leads up 15%”) using natural language summary.
•	Forecasting: In dashboards, show trend lines and forecasts (e.g. predicted monthly sales, social growth). Alert on anomalies (sudden drop in engagement) via EmailPreferences or notifications.
•	Customized Dashboards: Let users build drag-and-drop dashboards combining any metrics (sales, ads, website traffic, customer satisfaction). Include industry KPIs and benchmarks.
•	Reporting Builder: Enhance Reporting module so users can easily query across multiple data sources (mix marketing and finance data). Schedule and export reports (PDF/CSV) for stakeholders.
•	Ad-hoc Analysis Tools: Provide tools like pivot tables, custom SQL query builder (for advanced users or enterprise).
•	Integration with BI: (Future) Offer connectors to business intelligence tools (e.g. PowerBI, Tableau) for the largest clients who want to incorporate Pikar data into enterprise dashboards.
Notifications & Collaboration
•	Unified NotificationCenter: Aggregate alerts from all modules (task due, workflow completed, audit flagged) with filters (e.g. by priority). Support both in-app and email/SMS notifications.
•	Mobile Support: Push notifications for key events (e.g. “Sales target hit!” or “Approval needed”), so users can stay updated on the go.
•	Real-Time Collaboration: Build on CollaborationHub to include whiteboard sessions, shared calendars, and live document editing (e.g. Google Docs integration for co-authoring campaign briefs).
•	Team Chat: Include a simple chat or comment feature on workflows and initiatives, so team members can discuss within Pikar. Integrate with external chat apps for conversation history.
•	Meeting Integration: Sync with calendars to block time for Pikar tasks (e.g. “10 minutes to review A/B test results”).
Settings, Billing & Administration
•	Billing Flexibility: Support usage-based billing metrics (API calls, number of agents) in addition to flat tiers. Display detailed usage reports for admins.
•	Subscription Management: Allow pausing, upgrading, or downgrading plans in-app. Send reminders before renewals or when usage exceeds plan limits.
•	Feature Flags: Admins (in higher tiers) can toggle beta features on/off for their organization.
•	Audit & Compliance Reporting: Expand AdminAudit to include system-level events (e.g. login locations, API calls). Provide a Compliance Report exporting all needed info for external audits (e.g. export CAPA logs, user access logs).
•	Role Management: Besides Admin/User, add intermediate roles (e.g. Editor, Reviewer) for finer permissions. Allow custom role creation.
Non-Functional Requirements
•	Performance & Scalability: Ensure the platform scales to enterprises (millions of records, many concurrent users) without lag.
•	Reliability: Aim for high uptime (>99.9%), with disaster recovery and backups.
•	Security: Implement OWASP best practices. Conduct regular penetration testing. Offer regional data residency (for EU, etc.) if needed.
•	Internationalization: Provide multi-language UI support (starting with major languages) and multi-currency for financial modules.
•	Accessibility: Keep using accessible components (as currently) and test with screen-readers.
•	Logging & Monitoring: Internally track performance metrics and errors; alert on issues. Use logs (via AdminAudit) for forensic analysis.
Acceptance Criteria (Enhanced)
By our expanded PRD, a compliant user scenario includes:
•	A solopreneur signs up, completes onboarding questionnaire, and is presented a Discovery plan. They quickly generate a week’s worth of social posts and an email newsletter via Pikar’s AI tools, then schedule them. They see immediate performance predictions and later track actual results in simplified dashboard (aligned with their goal of brand awareness).
•	A startup team creates an Initiative, orchestrates a workflow: the Content Agent creates blog posts and ad copy, these are approved by a manager (MMR enforced), scheduled via SocialMediaMarketing, and performance is monitored in MarketingAnalytics. The Sales Agent syncs lead scoring with their CRM. They adjust strategy after reviewing snap-prioritized weekly tasks in their Dashboard.
•	An SME admin sets up multiple brands and workflows. They require any new campaign to pass a compliance checklist (Compliance Agent) before launch. A low-performing campaign automatically triggers a CAPA record in the QMS, assigning root cause analysis to a team. They export audit logs from AdminConsole for a board meeting.
•	The Enterprise’s security officer toggles a new data-export feature via AdminFlags and configures SSO. The CTO uses the Reporting builder to combine data from Pikar and their own ERP. They run the Business Diagnostic, get a prioritized list of tasks (via SNAP) for each department, and review KPI charts in PerformanceAnalytics. All while MMR ensures that AI-generated recommendations are being vetted by human experts according to corporate policy.
Future Considerations
Looking ahead, Pikar AI can continue evolving:
•	AI-First Innovations: Integrate large-language models (e.g. custom GPTs) so users can ask natural-language questions (e.g. “What content should I create next month?”). Enable voice interfaces for hands-free use.
•	Vertical Extensions: Develop plug-in modules for specific industries (healthcare marketing, legal compliance workflow, manufacturing IoT).
•	Community Ecosystem: Build a developer platform where third parties can create and sell Pikar extensions or data connectors.
•	Advanced Diagnostics: Enhance the Business Diagnostic into a full assessment wizard that quantifies business maturity and ROI of platform usage.
•	Global Scale: Prepare for localization (currencies, languages) and compliance with international regulations (e.g. data sovereignty laws) as Pikar targets worldwide markets.
