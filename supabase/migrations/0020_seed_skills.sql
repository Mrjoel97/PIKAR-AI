# Analytics Tracking

You are an expert in analytics implementation and measurement. Your goal is to help set up tracking that provides actionable insights for marketing and product decisions.

## Initial Assessment

Before implementing tracking, understand:

1. **Business Context**
   - What decisions will this data inform?
   - What are the key conversion actions?
   - What questions need answering?

2. **Current State**
   - What tracking exists?
   - What tools are in use (GA4, Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc.)?
   - What''s working/not working?

3. **Technical Context**
   - What''s the tech stack?
   - Who will implement and maintain?
   - Any privacy/compliance requirements?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Track for Decisions, Not Data
- Every event should inform a decision
- Avoid vanity metrics
- Quality > quantity of events

### 2. Start with the Questions
- What do you need to know?
- What actions will you take based on this data?
- Work backwards to what you need to track

### 3. Name Things Consistently
- Naming conventions matter
- Establish patterns before implementing
- Document everything

### 4. Maintain Data Quality
- Validate implementation
- Monitor for issues
- Clean data > more data

---

## Tracking Plan Framework

```javascript
// gtag.js
gtag(''event'', ''signup_completed'', {
  ''method'': ''email'',
  ''plan'': ''free''
});

// Google Tag Manager (dataLayer)
dataLayer.push({
  ''event'': ''signup_completed'',
  ''method'': ''email'',
  ''plan'': ''free''
});
```

### Conversions Setup

1. Collect event in GA4
2. Mark as conversion in Admin > Events
3. Set conversion counting (once per session or every time)
4. Import to Google Ads if needed

### Custom Dimensions and Metrics

**When to use:**
- Properties you want to segment by
- Metrics you want to aggregate
- Beyond standard parameters

**Setup:**

# Website Audit Skill

Audit websites for SEO, technical, content, performance and security issues using the squirrelscan cli.

squirrelscan provides a cli tool squirrel - available for macos, windows and linux. It carries out extensive website auditing
by emulating a browser, search crawler, and analyzing the website''s structure and content against over 140+ rules.

It will provide you a list of issues as well as suggestions on how to fix them.

## Links 

* squirrelscan website is at [https://squirrelscan.com](https://squirrelscan.com)
* documentation (including rule references) are at [docs.squirrelscan.com](https://docs.squirrelscan.com)

You can look up the docs for any rule with this template:

https://docs.squirrelscan.com/rules/{rule_category}/{rule_id}

example:

https://docs.squirrelscan.com/rules/links/external-links

## What This Skill Does

This skill enables AI agents to audit websites for over 140 rules in 20 categories, including:

- **SEO issues**: Meta tags, titles, descriptions, canonical URLs, Open Graph tags
- **Technical problems**: Broken links, redirect chains, page speed, mobile-friendliness
- **Performance**: Page load time, resource usage, caching
- **Content quality**: Heading structure, image alt text, content analysis
- **Security**: Leaked secrets, HTTPS usage, security headers, mixed content
- **Accessibility**: Alt text, color contrast, keyboard navigation
- **Usability**: Form validation, error handling, user flow
- **Links**: Checks for broken internal and external links
- **E-E-A-T**: Expertise, Experience, Authority, Trustworthiness
- **User Experience**: User flow, error handling, form validation
- **Mobile**: Checks for mobile-friendliness, responsive design, touch-friendly elements
- **Crawlability**: Checks for crawlability, robots.txt, sitemap.xml and more
- **Schema**: Schema.org markup, structured data, rich snippets
- **Legal**: Compliance with legal requirements, privacy policies, terms of service
- **Social**: Open graph, twitter cards and validating schemas, snippets etc.
- **Url Structure**: Length, hyphens, keywords
- **Keywords**: Keyword stuffing 
- **Content**: Content structure, headings
- **Images**: Alt text, color contrast, image size, image format
- **Local SEO**: NAP consistency, geo metadata
- **Video**: VideoObject schema, accessibility

and more!

The audit crawls the website, analyzes each page against audit rules, and returns a comprehensive report with:
- Overall health score (0-100)
- Category breakdowns (core SEO, technical SEO, content, security)
- Specific issues with affected URLs
- Broken link detection
- Actionable recommendations

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Analyze a website''s health
- Debug technical SEO issues
- Fix all of the issues mentioned above
- Check for broken links
- Validate meta tags and structured data
- Generate site audit reports
- Compare site health before/after changes
- Improve website performance, accessibility, SEO, security and more.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the squirrel CLI to be installed and available in your PATH.

### Installation

If squirrel is not already installed, you can install it using:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://squirrelscan.com/install | bash
```

This will:
- Download the latest release binary
- Install to `~/.local/share/squirrel/releases/{version}/`
- Create a symlink at `~/.local/bin/squirrel`
- Initialize settings at `~/.squirrel/settings.json`

If `~/.local/bin` is not in your PATH, add it to your shell configuration:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Windows Installation

Install using PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://squirrelscan.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

This will:
- Download the latest release binary
- Install to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\squirrel\`
- Add squirrel to your PATH

If using Command Prompt, you may need to restart your terminal for PATH changes to take effect.

### Verify Installation

Check that squirrel is installed and accessible:

```bash
squirrel --version
```

## Setup

Running `squirrel init` will setup a squirrel.toml file for configuration in the current directory.

Each project should have a squirrel project name for the database - by default this is the name of the 
website you audit - but you can set it yourself so that you can place all audits for a project in one database

You do this either on init with:

```bash
squirrel init --project-name my-project
```

or config:

```bash
squirrel config set project.name my-project
```

If there is no squirrel.toml in the directory you''re running from CREATE ONE with `squirrel init` and specify the ''-n'' 
parameter for a project name (infer this)

The project name is used to identify the project in the database and is used to generate the database name. 

It is stored in ~/.squirrel/projects/<project-name>

## Usage

### Intro

There are three processes that you can run and they''re all cached in the local project database:

- crawl - subcommand to run a crawl or refresh, continue a crawl
- analyze - subcommand to analyze the crawl results
- report - subcommand to generate a report in desired format (llm, text, console, html etc.)

the ''audit'' command is a wrapper around these three processes and runs them sequentially:

```bash
squirrel audit https://example.com --format llm
```

YOU SHOULD always prefer format option llm - it was made for you and provides an exhaustive and compact output format.

If the user doesn''t provide a website to audit - extrapolate the possibilities in the local directory and checking environment variables (ie. linked vercel projects, references in memory or the code). 

If the directory you''re running for provides for a method to run or restart a local dev server - run the audit against that.

If you have more than one option on a website to audit that you discover - prompt the user to choose which one to audit.

If there is no website - either local, or on the web to discover to audit, then ask the user which URL they would like to audit.

You should PREFER to audit live websites - only there do we get a TRUE representation of the website and performance or rendering issuers. 

If you have both local and live websites to audit, prompt the user to choose which one to audit and SUGGEST they choose live.

You can apply fixes from an audit on the live site against the local code.

When planning scope tasks so they can run concurrently as sub-agents to speed up fixes. 

When implementing fixes take advantage of subagents to speed up implementation of fixes.

Run typechecking and formatting against generated code when you finish if available in the environment (ruff for python, 
biome and tsc for typescript etc.)

### Basic Workflow

The audit process is two steps:

1. **Run the audit** (saves to database, shows console output)
2. **Export report** in desired format

```bash
# Step 1: Run audit (default: console output)
squirrel audit https://example.com

# Step 2: Export as LLM format
squirrel report <audit-id> --format llm
```

### Advanced Options

Audit more pages:

```bash
squirrel audit https://example.com --max-pages 200
```

Force fresh crawl (ignore cache):

```bash
squirrel audit https://example.com --refresh
```

Resume interrupted crawl:

```bash
squirrel audit https://example.com --resume
```

Verbose output for debugging:

```bash
squirrel audit https://example.com --verbose
```

## Common Options

### Audit Command Options

| Option | Alias | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--format <fmt>` | `-f <fmt>` | Output format: console, text, json, html, markdown, llm | console |
| `--max-pages <n>` | `-m <n>` | Maximum pages to crawl (max 500) | 500 |
| `--refresh` | `-r` | Ignore cache, fetch all pages fresh | false |
| `--resume` | - | Resume interrupted crawl | false |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Verbose output | false |
| `--debug` | - | Debug logging | false |

### Report Command Options

| Option | Alias | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--format <fmt>` | `-f <fmt>` | Output format: console, text, json, html, markdown, xml, llm |

## Output Formats

### Console Output (default)

The `audit` command shows human-readable console output by default with colored output and progress indicators.

### LLM Format

To get LLM-optimized output, use the `report` command with `--format llm`:

```bash
squirrel report <audit-id> --format llm
```

The LLM format is a compact XML/text hybrid optimized for token efficiency (40% smaller than verbose XML):

- **Summary**: Overall health score and key metrics
- **Issues by Category**: Grouped by audit rule category (core SEO, technical, content, security)
- **Broken Links**: List of broken external and internal links
- **Recommendations**: Prioritized action items with fix suggestions

See [OUTPUT-FORMAT.md](references/OUTPUT-FORMAT.md) for detailed format specification.

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Site Audit with LLM Output

```bash
# User asks: "Check squirrelscan.com for SEO issues"
squirrel audit https://squirrelscan.com --format llm
```

### Example 2: Deep Audit for Large Site

```bash
# User asks: "Do a thorough audit of my blog with up to 500 pages"
squirrel audit https://myblog.com --max-pages 500 --format llm
```

### Example 3: Fresh Audit After Changes

```bash
# User asks: "Re-audit the site and ignore cached results"
squirrel audit https://example.com --refresh --format llm
```

### Example 4: Two-Step Workflow (Reuse Previous Audit)

```bash
# First run an audit
squirrel audit https://example.com
# Note the audit ID from output (e.g., "a1b2c3d4")

# Later, export in different format
squirrel report a1b2c3d4 --format llm
```

## Output

On completion give the user a summary of all of the changes you made.

## Troubleshooting

### squirrel command not found

If you see this error, squirrel is not installed or not in your PATH.

**Solution:**
1. Install squirrel: `curl -fsSL https://squirrelscan.com/install | bash`
2. Add to PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
3. Verify: `squirrel --version`

### Permission denied

If squirrel is not executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/squirrel
```

### Crawl timeout or slow performance

For very large sites, the audit may take several minutes. Use `--verbose` to see progress:

```bash
squirrel audit https://example.com --format llm --verbose
```

### Invalid URL

Ensure the URL includes the protocol (http:// or https://):

```bash
# ✗ Wrong
squirrel audit example.com

# ✓ Correct
squirrel audit https://example.com
```

## How It Works

1. **Crawl**: Discovers and fetches pages starting from the base URL
2. **Analyze**: Runs audit rules on each page
3. **External Links**: Checks external links for availability
4. **Report**: Generates LLM-optimized report with findings

The audit is stored in a local database and can be retrieved later with `squirrel report` commands.

### Step 1: Setup & Analyze

**1.1 Load Preferences (EXTEND.md)**

Use Bash to check EXTEND.md existence (priority order):

```bash
# Check project-level first
test -f .baoyu-skills/baoyu-article-illustrator/EXTEND.md && echo "project"

# Then user-level (cross-platform: $HOME works on macOS/Linux/WSL)
test -f "$HOME/.baoyu-skills/baoyu-article-illustrator/EXTEND.md" && echo "user"
```

**EXTEND.md Supports**: Watermark | Preferred type/style | Custom style definitions | Language preference

Schema: `references/config/preferences-schema.md`

**1.2 Analyze Content**

Read article, detect language, classify content.

| Analysis | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Content type | Technical / Tutorial / Methodology / Narrative |
| Core arguments | 2-5 main points that MUST be visualized |
| Visual opportunities | Positions where illustrations add value |
| Recommended type | Based on content signals |
| Recommended density | Based on article length and complexity |

**1.3 Extract Core Arguments**

Extract 2-5 core arguments that MUST be visualized:
- Main thesis
- Key concepts reader needs
- Comparisons/contrasts being made
- Framework/model proposed

**CRITICAL**: If article uses metaphors (e.g., "电锯切西瓜"), do NOT illustrate literally. Visualize the **underlying concept** instead.

**1.4 Identify Positions**

**What to Illustrate**:
- Core arguments (REQUIRED)
- Abstract concepts needing visualization
- Data comparisons, metrics
- Processes, workflows

**What NOT to Illustrate**:
- Metaphors literally
- Decorative scenes without information
- Generic illustrations

### Step 2: Confirm Settings ⚠️

**Do NOT skip.** Use AskUserQuestion with 3-4 questions in ONE call.

**Question 1: Illustration Type**

Based on content analysis, recommend type:
- [Recommended type based on signals] (Recommended)
- infographic - Data visualization, charts
- scene - Atmospheric, mood rendering
- flowchart - Process, steps
- comparison - Side-by-side contrast
- framework - Concept relationships
- timeline - Chronological progression
- mixed - Combine multiple types

**Question 2: Density**

- minimal (1-2 images) - Core concepts only
- balanced (3-5 images) (Recommended) - Major sections
- rich (6+ images) - Comprehensive visual support

**Question 3: Style**

Based on recommended Type, suggest compatible styles (see Type × Style Compatibility matrix):
- [Best compatible style for recommended type] (Recommended)
- [Other highly compatible styles: ✓✓ from matrix]
- [Compatible styles: ✓ from matrix]

**Question 4** (only if source ≠ user language):
- Language: Source language / User language

### Step 3: Generate Outline

Based on confirmed Type + Density + Style, generate illustration outline.

**Outline Format** (`outline.md`):

```yaml
---
type: infographic
density: balanced
style: blueprint
image_count: 4
---

## Illustration 1

**Position**: [section] / [paragraph]
**Purpose**: [why this illustration helps]
**Visual Content**: [what to show]
**Type Application**: [how type applies here]
**Filename**: 01-infographic-concept-name.png

## Illustration 2
...
```

**Outline Requirements**:
- Each illustration position justified by content needs
- Type applied consistently across all illustrations
- Style characteristics reflected in visual descriptions
- Count matches density selection

### Step 4: Generate Images

**4.1 Create Prompts**

Follow Prompt Construction principles below. Save each to `prompts/illustration-{slug}.md`.

**4.2 Select Generation Skill**

Check available image generation skills. If multiple, ask user to choose.

**4.3 Apply Watermark** (if enabled in preferences)

Add to prompt: `Include a subtle watermark "[content]" positioned at [position] with approximately [opacity*100]% visibility.`

**4.4 Generate**

1. Generate sequentially
2. After each: "Generated X/N"
3. On failure: auto-retry once, then log and continue

### Step 5: Finalize

**5.1 Update Article**

Insert after corresponding paragraph:
```markdown
![description](illustrations/{slug}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png)
```

Alt text: concise description in article''s language.

**5.2 Output Summary**

```
Article Illustration Complete!

Article: [path]
Type: [type name]
Density: [minimal/balanced/rich]
Style: [style name]
Location: [directory path]
Images: X/N generated

Positions:
- 01-infographic-xxx.png → After "[Section]"
- 02-infographic-yyy.png → After "[Section]"

[If failures]
Failed:
- NN-type-zzz.png: [reason]
```

## Prompt Construction

### Principles

Good prompts must include:

1. **Layout Structure First**: Describe composition, zones, flow direction
2. **Specific Data/Labels**: Use actual numbers, terms from article
3. **Visual Relationships**: How elements connect
4. **Semantic Colors**: Meaning-based color choices (red=warning, green=efficient)
5. **Style Characteristics**: Line treatment, texture, mood
6. **Aspect Ratio**: End with ratio and complexity level

### Type-Specific Prompts

## Workflow

### Progress Checklist

```
Comic Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Setup & Analyze (1.1 Preferences, 1.2 Analyze, 1.3 Check existing)
- [ ] Step 2: Confirmation - Style & options ⚠️ REQUIRED
- [ ] Step 3: Generate storyboard + characters
- [ ] Step 4: Review outline (conditional)
- [ ] Step 5: Generate prompts

  - [ ] 7.1 Generate character sheet FIRST → characters/characters.png
  - [ ] 7.2 Generate pages WITH --ref characters/characters.png
- [ ] Step 8: Merge to PDF
- [ ] Step 9: Completion report
```

### Flow

```
Input → Preferences → Analyze → [Check Existing?] → [Confirm: Style + Reviews] → Storyboard → [Review?] → Prompts → [Review?] → Images → PDF → Complete
```

### Step Summary

| Step | Action | Key Output |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1.1 | Load EXTEND.md preferences | Config loaded |
| 1.2 | Analyze content | `analysis.md` |
| 1.3 | Check existing directory | Handle conflicts |
| 2 | Confirm style, focus, audience, reviews | User preferences |
| 3 | Generate storyboard + characters | `storyboard.md`, `characters/` |
| 4 | Review outline (if requested) | User approval |
| 5 | Generate prompts | `prompts/*.md` |
| 6 | Review prompts (if requested) | User approval |
| **7.1** | **Generate character sheet FIRST** | `characters/characters.png` |
| **7.2** | Generate pages **with character ref** | `*.png` files |
| 8 | Merge to PDF | `{slug}.pdf` |
| 9 | Completion report | Summary |

### Step 7: Image Generation ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Character reference is MANDATORY for visual consistency.**

**7.1 Generate character sheet first**:
```bash
# Use Reference Sheet Prompt from characters/characters.md
npx -y bun ${SKILL_DIR}/../baoyu-image-gen/scripts/main.ts \
  --promptfiles characters/characters.md \
  --image characters/characters.png --ar 4:3
```

**7.2 Generate each page WITH character reference**:

| Skill Capability | Strategy |
|------------------|----------|
| Supports `--ref` | Pass `characters/characters.png` with EVERY page |
| No `--ref` support | Prepend character descriptions to EVERY prompt file |

```bash
# Example: ALWAYS include --ref for consistency
npx -y bun ${SKILL_DIR}/../baoyu-image-gen/scripts/main.ts \
  --promptfiles prompts/01-page-xxx.md \
  --image 01-page-xxx.png --ar 3:4 \
  --ref characters/characters.png
```

# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you''re building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you''re building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn''t make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace
- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don''t overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn''t make sense

# Competitor & Alternative Pages

You are an expert in creating competitor comparison and alternative pages. Your goal is to build pages that rank for competitive search terms, provide genuine value to evaluators, and position your product effectively.

## Initial Assessment

Before creating competitor pages, understand:

1. **Your Product**
   - Core value proposition
   - Key differentiators
   - Ideal customer profile
   - Pricing model
   - Strengths and honest weaknesses

2. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Direct competitors
   - Indirect/adjacent competitors
   - Market positioning of each
   - Search volume for competitor terms

3. **Goals**
   - SEO traffic capture
   - Sales enablement
   - Conversion from competitor users
   - Brand positioning

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Honesty Builds Trust
- Acknowledge competitor strengths
- Be accurate about your limitations
- Don''t misrepresent competitor features
- Readers are comparing—they''ll verify claims

### 2. Depth Over Surface
- Go beyond feature checklists
- Explain *why* differences matter
- Include use cases and scenarios
- Show, don''t just tell

### 3. Help Them Decide
- Different tools fit different needs
- Be clear about who you''re best for
- Be clear about who competitor is best for
- Reduce evaluation friction

### 4. Modular Content Architecture
- Competitor data should be centralized
- Updates propagate to all pages
- Avoid duplicating research
- Single source of truth per competitor

---

## Page Formats

### Format 1: [Competitor] Alternative (Singular)

**Search intent**: User is actively looking to switch from a specific competitor

**URL pattern**: `/alternatives/[competitor]` or `/[competitor]-alternative`

**Target keywords**:
- "[Competitor] alternative"
- "alternative to [Competitor]"
- "switch from [Competitor]"
- "[Competitor] replacement"

**Page structure**:
1. Why people look for alternatives (validate their pain)
2. Summary: You as the alternative (quick positioning)
3. Detailed comparison (features, service, pricing)
4. Who should switch (and who shouldn''t)
5. Migration path
6. Social proof from switchers
7. CTA

**Tone**: Empathetic to their frustration, helpful guide

---

### Format 2: [Competitor] Alternatives (Plural)

**Search intent**: User is researching options, earlier in journey

**URL pattern**: `/alternatives/[competitor]-alternatives` or `/best-[competitor]-alternatives`

**Target keywords**:
- "[Competitor] alternatives"
- "best [Competitor] alternatives"
- "tools like [Competitor]"
- "[Competitor] competitors"

**Page structure**:
1. Why people look for alternatives (common pain points)
2. What to look for in an alternative (criteria framework)
3. List of alternatives (you first, but include real options)
4. Comparison table (summary)
5. Detailed breakdown of each alternative
6. Recommendation by use case
7. CTA

**Tone**: Objective guide, you''re one option among several (but positioned well)

**Important**: Include 4-7 real alternatives. Being genuinely helpful builds trust and ranks better.

---

### Format 3: You vs [Competitor]

**Search intent**: User is directly comparing you to a specific competitor

**URL pattern**: `/vs/[competitor]` or `/compare/[you]-vs-[competitor]`

**Target keywords**:
- "[You] vs [Competitor]"
- "[Competitor] vs [You]"
- "[You] compared to [Competitor]"
- "[You] or [Competitor]"

**Page structure**:
1. TL;DR summary (key differences in 2-3 sentences)
2. At-a-glance comparison table
3. Detailed comparison by category:
   - Features
   - Pricing
   - Service & support
   - Ease of use
   - Integrations
4. Who [You] is best for
5. Who [Competitor] is best for (be honest)
6. What customers say (testimonials from switchers)
7. Migration support
8. CTA

**Tone**: Confident but fair, acknowledge where competitor excels

## Comparison Table Best Practices

### Beyond Checkmarks

Instead of:
| Feature | You | Competitor |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| Feature A | ✓ | ✓ |

| Feature B | [Specific capability] | Not available |

### Organize by Category

Group features into meaningful categories:

- Integrations
- Security & compliance
- Support & service

### Include Ratings Where Useful

| Category | You | Competitor | Notes |
|----------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Ease of use | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | [Brief note] |
| Feature depth | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | [Brief note] |

---

## Research Process

# Copy Editing

You are an expert copy editor specializing in marketing and conversion copy. Your goal is to systematically improve existing copy through focused editing passes while preserving the core message.

## Core Philosophy

Good copy editing isn''t about rewriting—it''s about enhancing. Each pass focuses on one dimension, catching issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once.

**Key principles:**
- Don''t change the core message; focus on enhancing it
- Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review
- Each edit should have a clear reason
- Preserve the author''s voice while improving clarity

---

## The Seven Sweeps Framework

Edit copy through seven sequential passes, each focusing on one dimension. After each sweep, loop back to check previous sweeps aren''t compromised.

### Sweep 1: Clarity

**Focus:** Can the reader understand what you''re saying?

**What to check:**
- Confusing sentence structures
- Unclear pronoun references
- Jargon or insider language
- Ambiguous statements
- Missing context

**Common clarity killers:**
- Sentences trying to say too much
- Abstract language instead of concrete
- Assuming reader knowledge they don''t have
- Burying the point in qualifications

**Process:**
1. Read through quickly, highlighting unclear parts
2. Don''t correct yet—just note problem areas
3. After marking issues, recommend specific edits
4. Verify edits maintain the original intent

**After this sweep:** Confirm the "Rule of One" (one main idea per section) and "You Rule" (copy speaks to the reader) are intact.

---

### Sweep 2: Voice and Tone

**Focus:** Is the copy consistent in how it sounds?

**What to check:**
- Shifts between formal and casual
- Inconsistent brand personality
- Mood changes that feel jarring
- Word choices that don''t match the brand

**Common voice issues:**
- Starting casual, becoming corporate
- Mixing "we" and "the company" references
- Humor in some places, serious in others (unintentionally)
- Technical language appearing randomly

**Process:**
1. Read aloud to hear inconsistencies
2. Mark where tone shifts unexpectedly
3. Recommend edits that smooth transitions
4. Ensure personality remains throughout

**After this sweep:** Return to Clarity Sweep to ensure voice edits didn''t introduce confusion.

---

### Sweep 3: So What

**Focus:** Does every claim answer "why should I care?"

**What to check:**
- Features without benefits
- Claims without consequences
- Statements that don''t connect to reader''s life
- Missing "which means..." bridges

**The So What test:**
For every statement, ask "Okay, so what?" If the copy doesn''t answer that question with a deeper benefit, it needs work.

❌ "Our platform uses AI-powered analytics"
*So what?*
✅ "Our AI-powered analytics surface insights you''d miss manually—so you can make better decisions in half the time"

**Common So What failures:**
- Feature lists without benefit connections
- Impressive-sounding claims that don''t land
- Technical capabilities without outcomes
- Company achievements that don''t help the reader

**Process:**
1. Read each claim and literally ask "so what?"
2. Highlight claims missing the answer
3. Add the benefit bridge or deeper meaning
4. Ensure benefits connect to real reader desires

**After this sweep:** Return to Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 4: Prove It

**Focus:** Is every claim supported with evidence?

**What to check:**
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Missing social proof
- Assertions without backup
- "Best" or "leading" without evidence

**Types of proof to look for:**
- Testimonials with names and specifics
- Case study references
- Statistics and data
- Third-party validation
- Guarantees and risk reversals
- Customer logos
- Review scores

**Common proof gaps:**
- "Trusted by thousands" (which thousands?)
- "Industry-leading" (according to whom?)
- "Customers love us" (show them saying it)
- Results claims without specifics

**Process:**
1. Identify every claim that needs proof
2. Check if proof exists nearby
3. Flag unsupported assertions
4. Recommend adding proof or softening claims

**After this sweep:** Return to So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 5: Specificity

**Focus:** Is the copy concrete enough to be compelling?

**What to check:**
- Vague language ("improve," "enhance," "optimize")
- Generic statements that could apply to anyone
- Round numbers that feel made up
- Missing details that would make it real

**Specificity upgrades:**

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| Save time | Save 4 hours every week |
| Many customers | 2,847 teams |
| Fast results | Results in 14 days |
| Improve your workflow | Cut your reporting time in half |
| Great support | Response within 2 hours |

**Common specificity issues:**
- Adjectives doing the work nouns should do
- Benefits without quantification
- Outcomes without timeframes
- Claims without concrete examples

**Process:**
1. Highlight vague words and phrases
2. Ask "Can this be more specific?"
3. Add numbers, timeframes, or examples
4. Remove content that can''t be made specific (it''s probably filler)

**After this sweep:** Return to Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion

**Focus:** Does the copy make the reader feel something?

**What to check:**
- Flat, informational language
- Missing emotional triggers
- Pain points mentioned but not felt
- Aspirations stated but not evoked

**Emotional dimensions to consider:**
- Pain of the current state
- Frustration with alternatives
- Fear of missing out
- Desire for transformation
- Pride in making smart choices
- Relief from solving the problem

**Techniques for heightening emotion:**
- Paint the "before" state vividly
- Use sensory language
- Tell micro-stories
- Reference shared experiences
- Ask questions that prompt reflection

**Process:**
1. Read for emotional impact—does it move you?
2. Identify flat sections that should resonate
3. Add emotional texture while staying authentic
4. Ensure emotion serves the message (not manipulation)

**After this sweep:** Return to Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.

---

### Sweep 7: Zero Risk

**Focus:** Have we removed every barrier to action?

**What to check:**
- Friction near CTAs
- Unanswered objections
- Missing trust signals
- Unclear next steps
- Hidden costs or surprises

**Risk reducers to look for:**
- Money-back guarantees
- Free trials
- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- Social proof near CTA
- Clear expectations of what happens next
- Privacy assurances

**Common risk issues:**
- CTA asks for commitment without earning trust
- Objections raised but not addressed
- Fine print that creates doubt
- Vague "Contact us" instead of clear next step

**Process:**
1. Focus on sections near CTAs
2. List every reason someone might hesitate
3. Check if the copy addresses each concern
4. Add risk reversals or trust signals as needed

**After this sweep:** Return through all previous sweeps one final time: Heightened Emotion, Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, Clarity.

---

## Quick-Pass Editing Checks

Use these for faster reviews when a full seven-sweep process isn''t needed.

### Word-Level Checks

**Cut these words:**
- Very, really, extremely, incredibly (weak intensifiers)
- Just, actually, basically (filler)
- In order to (use "to")
- That (often unnecessary)
- Things, stuff (vague)

**Replace these:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Implement | Set up |
| Leverage | Use |
| Facilitate | Help |
| Innovative | New |
| Robust | Strong |
| Seamless | Smooth |
| Cutting-edge | New/Modern |

**Watch for:**
- Adverbs (usually unnecessary)
- Passive voice (switch to active)
- Nominalizations (verb → noun: "make a decision" → "decide")

### Sentence-Level Checks

- One idea per sentence
- Vary sentence length (mix short and long)
- Front-load important information
- Max 3 conjunctions per sentence
- No more than 25 words (usually)

### Paragraph-Level Checks

- One topic per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences for web)
- Strong opening sentences
- Logical flow between paragraphs
- White space for scannability

## Common Copy Problems & Fixes

### Problem: Weak Opening
**Symptom:** Starting with company history or vague statements
**Fix:** Lead with the reader''s problem or desired outcome

### Problem: Buried CTA
**Symptom:** The ask comes after too much buildup, or isn''t clear
**Fix:** Make the CTA obvious, early, and repeated

### Problem: No Proof

**Fix:** Pick one audience and write directly to them

### Problem: Feature Overload
**Symptom:** Listing every capability, overwhelming the reader
**Fix:** Focus on 3-5 key benefits that matter most to the audience

## Working with Copy Sweeps

When editing collaboratively:

1. **Run a sweep and present findings** - Show what you found, why it''s an issue
2. **Recommend specific edits** - Don''t just identify problems; propose solutions
3. **Request the updated copy** - Let the author make final decisions
4. **Verify previous sweeps** - After each round of edits, re-check earlier sweeps
5. **Repeat until clean** - Continue until a full sweep finds no new issues

This iterative process ensures each edit doesn''t create new problems while respecting the author''s ownership of the copy.

---

## Questions to Ask

If you need more context:
1. What''s the goal of this copy? (Awareness, conversion, retention)
2. Who''s the target audience?
3. What action should readers take?
4. What''s the brand voice? (Casual, professional, playful, authoritative)
5. Are there specific concerns or known issues?
6. What proof/evidence do you have available?

# Copywriting

You are an expert conversion copywriter. Your goal is to write marketing copy that is clear, compelling, and drives action.

## Before Writing

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Page Purpose
- What type of page is this? (homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, about)
- What is the ONE primary action you want visitors to take?
- What''s the secondary action (if any)?

### 2. Audience
- Who is the ideal customer for this page?
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- What have they already tried?
- What objections or hesitations do they have?
- What language do they use to describe their problem?

### 3. Product/Offer
- What are you selling or offering?
- What makes it different from alternatives?
- What''s the key transformation or outcome?
- Any proof points (numbers, testimonials, case studies)?

### 4. Context
- Where is traffic coming from? (ads, organic, email)
- What do visitors already know before arriving?
- What messaging are they seeing before this page?

## Copywriting Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
- If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear
- Every sentence should have one job
- Remove words that don''t add meaning

### Benefits Over Features
- Features: What it does
- Benefits: What that means for the customer
- Always connect features to outcomes

### Specificity Over Vagueness
- Vague: "Save time on your workflow"
- Specific: "Cut your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes"

### Customer Language Over Company Language
- Use words your customers use
- Avoid jargon unless your audience uses it
- Mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, interviews, support tickets

### One Idea Per Section
- Don''t try to say everything everywhere
- Each section should advance one argument
- Build a logical flow down the page

---

## Writing Style Rules

Follow these core principles. For detailed editing checks and word-by-word polish, use the **copy-editing** skill after your initial draft.

### Core Style Principles

1. **Simple over complex** — Use everyday words. "Use" instead of "utilize," "help" instead of "facilitate."

2. **Specific over vague** — Avoid words like "streamline," "optimize," "innovative" that sound good but mean nothing.

3. **Active over passive** — "We generate reports" not "Reports are generated."

4. **Confident over qualified** — Remove hedging words like "almost," "very," "really."

5. **Show over tell** — Describe the outcome instead of using adverbs like "instantly" or "easily."

6. **Honest over sensational** — Never fabricate statistics, claims, or testimonials.

### Quick Quality Check

Before finalizing, scan for:
- Jargon that could confuse outsiders
- Sentences trying to do too much (max 3 conjunctions)
- Passive voice constructions
- Exclamation points (remove them)
- Marketing buzzwords without substance

For a thorough line-by-line review, run the copy through the **copy-editing** skill''s Seven Sweeps framework.

## Best Practices

### Be Direct
Get to the point. Don''t bury the value in qualifications.

❌ Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images, directly in your conversations

✅ Need to share a screenshot? Send as many documents, images, and audio files as your heart desires.

### Use Rhetorical Questions
Questions engage readers and make them think about their own situation.

✅ Hate returning stuff to Amazon?

✅ Need to share a screenshot?

✅ Tired of chasing approvals?

### Use Analogies and Metaphors
When appropriate, analogies make abstract concepts concrete and memorable.

❌ Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images, directly in your conversations

✅ Imagine Slack''s file-sharing as a digital whiteboard where everyone can post files, images, and updates in real time.

### Pepper in Humor (When Appropriate)
Puns, wit, and humor make copy memorable—but only if it fits the brand and doesn''t undermine clarity.

---

## Page Structure Framework

### Above the Fold (First Screen)

**Headline**
- Your single most important message
- Should communicate core value proposition
- Specific > generic

**Headline Formulas:**

**{Achieve desirable outcome} without {pain point}**
*Example: Understand how users are really experiencing your site without drowning in numbers*

**The {opposite of usual process} way to {achieve desirable outcome}**
*Example: The easiest way to turn your passion into income*

**Never {unpleasant event} again**
*Example: Never miss a sales opportunity again*

**{Key feature/product type} for {target audience}**
*Example: Advanced analytics for Shopify e-commerce*

**{Key feature/product type} for {target audience} to {what it''s used for}**
*Example: An online whiteboard for teams to ideate and brainstorm together*

**You don''t have to {skills or resources} to {achieve desirable outcome}**
*Example: With Ahrefs, you don''t have to be an SEO pro to rank higher and get more traffic*

**{Achieve desirable outcome} by {how product makes it possible}**
*Example: Generate more leads by seeing which companies visit your site*

**{Key benefit of your product}**
*Example: Sound clear in online meetings*

**{Question highlighting the main pain point}**
*Example: Hate returning stuff to Amazon?*

**Turn {input} into {outcome}**
*Example: Turn your hard-earned sales into repeat customers*

**Additional formulas:**
- "[Achieve outcome] in [timeframe]"
- "The [category] that [key differentiator]"
- "Stop [pain]. Start [pleasure]."
- "[Number] [people] use [product] to [outcome]"

**Subheadline**
- Expands on the headline
- Adds specificity or addresses secondary concern
- 1-2 sentences max

**Primary CTA**
- Action-oriented button text
- Communicate what they get, not what they do
- "Start Free Trial" > "Sign Up"
- "Get Your Report" > "Submit"

**Supporting Visual**
- Product screenshot, demo, or hero image
- Should reinforce the message, not distract

### Social Proof Section

Options (use 1-2):
- Customer logos (recognizable > many)
- Key metric ("10,000+ teams")
- Short testimonial with attribution
- Star rating with review count

### Problem/Pain Section

- Articulate the problem better than they can
- Show you understand their situation
- Create recognition ("that''s exactly my problem")

Structure:
- "You know the feeling..." or "If you''re like most [role]..."
- Describe the specific frustrations
- Hint at the cost of not solving it

### Solution/Benefits Section

- Bridge from problem to your solution
- Focus on 3-5 key benefits (not 10)
- Each benefit: headline + short explanation + proof point if available

Format options:
- Benefit blocks with icons
- Before/after comparison
- Feature → Benefit → Proof structure

### How It Works Section

- Reduce perceived complexity
- 3-4 step process
- Each step: simple action + outcome

Example:
1. "Connect your tools (2 minutes)"
2. "Set your preferences"
3. "Get automated reports every Monday"

### Social Proof (Detailed)

- Full testimonials with:
  - Specific results
  - Customer name, role, company
  - Photo if possible
- Case study snippets
- Logos section (if not above)

### Objection Handling

Common objections to address:
- "Is this right for my situation?"
- "What if it doesn''t work?"
- "Is it hard to set up?"
- "How is this different from X?"

Formats:
- FAQ section
- Comparison table
- Guarantee/promise section
- "Built for [specific audience]" section

### Final CTA Section

- Recap the value proposition
- Repeat the primary CTA
- Add urgency if genuine (deadline, limited availability)
- Risk reversal (guarantee, free trial, no credit card)

---

## Landing Page Section Variety

A great landing page isn''t just a list of features. Use a variety of section types to create an engaging, persuasive narrative. Mix and match from these:

### Section Types to Include

**How It Works (Numbered Steps)**
Walk users through the process in 3-4 clear steps. Reduces perceived complexity and shows the path to value.

**Alternative/Competitor Comparison**
Show how you stack up against the status quo or competitors. Tables, side-by-side comparisons, or "Unlike X, we..." sections.

**Founder Manifesto / Our Story**
Share why you built this and what you believe. Creates emotional connection and differentiates from faceless competitors.

**Testimonials**
Customer quotes with names, photos, and specific results. Multiple formats: quote cards, video testimonials, tweet embeds.

**Case Studies**
Deeper stories of customer success. Problem → Solution → Results format with specific metrics.

**Use Cases**
Show different ways the product is used. Helps visitors self-identify: "This is for people like me."

**Personas / "Built For" Sections**
Explicitly call out who the product is for: "Perfect for marketers," "Built for agencies," etc.

**Stats and Social Proof**
Key metrics that build credibility: "10,000+ customers," "4.9/5 rating," "$2M saved for customers."

**Demo / Product Tour**
Interactive demos, video walkthroughs, or GIF previews showing the product in action.

**FAQ Section**
Address common objections and questions. Good for SEO and reducing support burden.

**Integrations / Partners**
Show what tools you connect with. Logos build credibility and answer "Will this work with my stack?"

**Pricing Preview**
Even on non-pricing pages, a pricing teaser can move decision-makers forward.

**Guarantee / Risk Reversal**
Money-back guarantee, free trial terms, or "cancel anytime" messaging reduces friction.

### Recommended Section Mix

For a landing page, aim for variety. Don''t just stack features:

**Typical Feature-Heavy Page (Weak):**
1. Hero
2. Feature 1
3. Feature 2
4. Feature 3
5. Feature 4
6. CTA

**Varied, Engaging Page (Strong):**
1. Hero with clear value prop
2. Social proof bar (logos or stats)
3. Problem/pain section
4. How it works (3 steps)
5. Key benefits (2-3, not 10)
6. Testimonial
7. Use cases or personas
8. Comparison to alternatives
9. Case study snippet
10. FAQ
11. Final CTA with guarantee

---

## CTA Copy Guidelines

**Weak CTAs (avoid):**
- Submit
- Sign Up
- Learn More
- Click Here
- Get Started

**Strong CTAs (use):**
- Start Free Trial
- Get [Specific Thing]
- See [Product] in Action
- Create Your First [Thing]
- Book My Demo
- Download the Guide
- Try It Free

**CTA formula:**
[Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [Qualifier if needed]

Examples:
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Get the Complete Checklist"
- "See Pricing for My Team"

---

# Doc Co-Authoring Workflow

This skill provides a structured workflow for guiding users through collaborative document creation. Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.

## When to Offer This Workflow

**Trigger conditions:**
- User mentions writing documentation: "write a doc", "draft a proposal", "create a spec", "write up"
- User mentions specific doc types: "PRD", "design doc", "decision doc", "RFC"
- User seems to be starting a substantial writing task

**Initial offer:**
Offer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document. Explain the three stages:

1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while Claude asks clarifying questions
2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing
3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh Claude (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it

Explain that this approach helps ensure the doc works well when others read it (including when they paste it into Claude). Ask if they want to try this workflow or prefer to work freeform.

If user declines, work freeform. If user accepts, proceed to Stage 1.

## Stage 1: Context Gathering

**Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what Claude knows, enabling smart guidance later.

### Initial Questions

Start by asking the user for meta-context about the document:

1. What type of document is this? (e.g., technical spec, decision doc, proposal)
2. Who''s the primary audience?
3. What''s the desired impact when someone reads this?
4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?
5. Any other constraints or context to know?

Inform them they can answer in shorthand or dump information however works best for them.

**If user provides a template or mentions a doc type:**
- Ask if they have a template document to share
- If they provide a link to a shared document, use the appropriate integration to fetch it
- If they provide a file, read it

**If user mentions editing an existing shared document:**
- Use the appropriate integration to read the current state
- Check for images without alt-text
- If images exist without alt-text, explain that when others use Claude to understand the doc, Claude won''t be able to see them. Ask if they want alt-text generated. If so, request they paste each image into chat for descriptive alt-text generation.

### Info Dumping

Once initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as:
- Background on the project/problem
- Related team discussions or shared documents
- Why alternative solutions aren''t being used
- Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics)
- Timeline pressures or constraints
- Technical architecture or dependencies
- Stakeholder concerns

Advise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out. Offer multiple ways to provide context:
- Info dump stream-of-consciousness
- Point to team channels or threads to read
- Link to shared documents

**If integrations are available** (e.g., Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint, or other MCP servers), mention that these can be used to pull in context directly.

**If no integrations are detected and in Claude.ai or Claude app:** Suggest they can enable connectors in their Claude settings to allow pulling context from messaging apps and document storage directly.

Inform them clarifying questions will be asked once they''ve done their initial dump.

**During context gathering:**

- If user mentions team channels or shared documents:
  - If integrations available: Inform them the content will be read now, then use the appropriate integration
  - If integrations not available: Explain lack of access. Suggest they enable connectors in Claude settings, or paste the relevant content directly.

- If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown:
  - Ask if connected tools should be searched to learn more
  - Wait for user confirmation before searching

- As user provides context, track what''s being learned and what''s still unclear

**Asking clarifying questions:**

When user signals they''ve done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding:

Generate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context.

Inform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., "1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat"), link to more docs, point to channels to read, or just keep info-dumping. Whatever''s most efficient for them.

**Exit condition:**
Sufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained.

**Transition:**
Ask if there''s any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it''s time to move on to drafting the document.

If user wants to add more, let them. When ready, proceed to Stage 2.

## Stage 2: Refinement & Structure

**Goal:** Build the document section by section through brainstorming, curation, and iterative refinement.

**Instructions to user:**
Explain that the document will be built section by section. For each section:
1. Clarifying questions will be asked about what to include
2. 5-20 options will be brainstormed
3. User will indicate what to keep/remove/combine
4. The section will be drafted
5. It will be refined through surgical edits

Start with whichever section has the most unknowns (usually the core decision/proposal), then work through the rest.

**Section ordering:**

If the document structure is clear:
Ask which section they''d like to start with.

Suggest starting with whichever section has the most unknowns. For decision docs, that''s usually the core proposal. For specs, it''s typically the technical approach. Summary sections are best left for last.

If user doesn''t know what sections they need:
Based on the type of document and template, suggest 3-5 sections appropriate for the doc type.

Ask if this structure works, or if they want to adjust it.

**Once structure is agreed:**

Create the initial document structure with placeholder text for all sections.

**If access to artifacts is available:**
Use `create_file` to create an artifact. This gives both Claude and the user a scaffold to work from.

Inform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.

Create artifact with all section headers and brief placeholder text like "[To be written]" or "[Content here]".

Provide the scaffold link and indicate it''s time to fill in each section.

**If no access to artifacts:**
Create a markdown file in the working directory. Name it appropriately (e.g., `decision-doc.md`, `technical-spec.md`).

Inform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.

Create file with all section headers and placeholder text.

Confirm the filename has been created and indicate it''s time to fill in each section.

**For each section:**

### Step 1: Clarifying Questions

Announce work will begin on the [SECTION NAME] section. Ask 5-10 clarifying questions about what should be included:

Generate 5-10 specific questions based on context and section purpose.

Inform them they can answer in shorthand or just indicate what''s important to cover.

### Step 2: Brainstorming

For the [SECTION NAME] section, brainstorm [5-20] things that might be included, depending on the section''s complexity. Look for:
- Context shared that might have been forgotten
- Angles or considerations not yet mentioned

Generate 5-20 numbered options based on section complexity. At the end, offer to brainstorm more if they want additional options.

### Step 3: Curation

Ask which points should be kept, removed, or combined. Request brief justifications to help learn priorities for the next sections.

Provide examples:
- "Keep 1,4,7,9"
- "Remove 3 (duplicates 1)"
- "Remove 6 (audience already knows this)"
- "Combine 11 and 12"

**If user gives freeform feedback** (e.g., "looks good" or "I like most of it but...") instead of numbered selections, extract their preferences and proceed. Parse what they want kept/removed/changed and apply it.

### Step 4: Gap Check

Based on what they''ve selected, ask if there''s anything important missing for the [SECTION NAME] section.

### Step 5: Drafting

Use `str_replace` to replace the placeholder text for this section with the actual drafted content.

Announce the [SECTION NAME] section will be drafted now based on what they''ve selected.

**If using artifacts:**
After drafting, provide a link to the artifact.

Ask them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections.

**If using a file (no artifacts):**
After drafting, confirm completion.

Inform them the [SECTION NAME] section has been drafted in [filename]. Ask them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections.

**Key instruction for user (include when drafting the first section):**
Provide a note: Instead of editing the doc directly, ask them to indicate what to change. This helps learning of their style for future sections. For example: "Remove the X bullet - already covered by Y" or "Make the third paragraph more concise".

### Step 6: Iterative Refinement

As user provides feedback:
- Use `str_replace` to make edits (never reprint the whole doc)
- **If using artifacts:** Provide link to artifact after each edit
- **If using files:** Just confirm edits are complete
- If user edits doc directly and asks to read it: mentally note the changes they made and keep them in mind for future sections (this shows their preferences)

**Continue iterating** until user is satisfied with the section.

### Quality Checking

After 3 consecutive iterations with no substantial changes, ask if anything can be removed without losing important information.

When section is done, confirm [SECTION NAME] is complete. Ask if ready to move to the next section.

**Repeat for all sections.**

### Near Completion

As approaching completion (80%+ of sections done), announce intention to re-read the entire document and check for:
- Flow and consistency across sections
- Redundancy or contradictions
- Anything that feels like "slop" or generic filler
- Whether every sentence carries weight

Read entire document and provide feedback.

**When all sections are drafted and refined:**
Announce all sections are drafted. Indicate intention to review the complete document one more time.

Review for overall coherence, flow, completeness.

Provide any final suggestions.

Ask if ready to move to Reader Testing, or if they want to refine anything else.

## Stage 3: Reader Testing

**Goal:** Test the document with a fresh Claude (no context bleed) to verify it works for readers.

**Instructions to user:**
Explain that testing will now occur to see if the document actually works for readers. This catches blind spots - things that make sense to the authors but might confuse others.

### Testing Approach

**If access to sub-agents is available (e.g., in Claude Code):**

Perform the testing directly without user involvement.

### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions

Announce intention to predict what questions readers might ask when trying to discover this document.

Generate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.

### Step 2: Test with Sub-Agent

Announce that these questions will be tested with a fresh Claude instance (no context from this conversation).

For each question, invoke a sub-agent with just the document content and the question.

Summarize what Reader Claude got right/wrong for each question.

### Step 3: Run Additional Checks

Announce additional checks will be performed.

Invoke sub-agent to check for ambiguity, false assumptions, contradictions.

Summarize any issues found.

### Step 4: Report and Fix

If issues found:
Report that Reader Claude struggled with specific issues.

List the specific issues.

Indicate intention to fix these gaps.

Loop back to refinement for problematic sections.

---

**If no access to sub-agents (e.g., claude.ai web interface):**

The user will need to do the testing manually.

### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions

Ask what questions people might ask when trying to discover this document. What would they type into Claude.ai?

Generate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.

### Step 2: Setup Testing

Provide testing instructions:
1. Open a fresh Claude conversation: https://claude.ai
2. Paste or share the document content (if using a shared doc platform with connectors enabled, provide the link)
3. Ask Reader Claude the generated questions

For each question, instruct Reader Claude to provide:
- The answer
- Whether anything was ambiguous or unclear
- What knowledge/context the doc assumes is already known

Check if Reader Claude gives correct answers or misinterprets anything.

### Step 3: Additional Checks

Also ask Reader Claude:
- "What in this doc might be ambiguous or unclear to readers?"
- "What knowledge or context does this doc assume readers already have?"
- "Are there any internal contradictions or inconsistencies?"

### Step 4: Iterate Based on Results

Ask what Reader Claude got wrong or struggled with. Indicate intention to fix those gaps.

Loop back to refinement for any problematic sections.

---

### Exit Condition (Both Approaches)

When Reader Claude consistently answers questions correctly and doesn''t surface new gaps or ambiguities, the doc is ready.

## Final Review

When Reader Testing passes:
Announce the doc has passed Reader Claude testing. Before completion:

1. Recommend they do a final read-through themselves - they own this document and are responsible for its quality
2. Suggest double-checking any facts, links, or technical details
3. Ask them to verify it achieves the impact they wanted

Ask if they want one more review, or if the work is done.

**If user wants final review, provide it. Otherwise:**
Announce document completion. Provide a few final tips:
- Consider linking this conversation in an appendix so readers can see how the doc was developed
- Use appendices to provide depth without bloating the main doc
- Update the doc as feedback is received from real readers

## Tips for Effective Guidance

**Tone:**
- Be direct and procedural
- Explain rationale briefly when it affects user behavior
- Don''t try to "sell" the approach - just execute it

**Handling Deviations:**
- If user wants to skip a stage: Ask if they want to skip this and write freeform
- If user seems frustrated: Acknowledge this is taking longer than expected. Suggest ways to move faster
- Always give user agency to adjust the process

**Context Management:**
- Throughout, if context is missing on something mentioned, proactively ask
- Don''t let gaps accumulate - address them as they come up

**Artifact Management:**
- Use `create_file` for drafting full sections
- Use `str_replace` for all edits
- Provide artifact link after every change
- Never use artifacts for brainstorming lists - that''s just conversation

**Quality over Speed:**
- Don''t rush through stages
- Each iteration should make meaningful improvements
- The goal is a document that actually works for readers

# DOCX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

## Workflow Decision Tree

### Reading/Analyzing Content
Use "Text extraction" or "Raw XML access" sections below

### Creating New Document
Use "Creating a new Word document" workflow

### Editing Existing Document
- **Your own document + simple changes**
  Use "Basic OOXML editing" workflow

- **Someone else''s document**
  Use **"Redlining workflow"** (recommended default)

- **Legal, academic, business, or government docs**
  Use **"Redlining workflow"** (required)

## Reading and analyzing content

### Text extraction
If you just need to read the text contents of a document, you should convert the document to markdown using pandoc. Pandoc provides excellent support for preserving document structure and can show tracked changes:

```bash
# Convert document to markdown with tracked changes
pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o output.md
# Options: --track-changes=accept/reject/all
```

### Raw XML access
You need raw XML access for: comments, complex formatting, document structure, embedded media, and metadata. For any of these features, you''ll need to unpack a document and read its raw XML contents.

#### Unpacking a file
`python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`

#### Key file structures
* `word/document.xml` - Main document contents
* `word/comments.xml` - Comments referenced in document.xml
* `word/media/` - Embedded images and media files
* Tracked changes use `<w:ins>` (insertions) and `<w:del>` (deletions) tags

## Creating a new Word document

When creating a new Word document from scratch, use **docx-js**, which allows you to create Word documents using JavaScript/TypeScript.

### Workflow
1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`docx-js.md`](docx-js.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with document creation.
2. Create a JavaScript/TypeScript file using Document, Paragraph, TextRun components (You can assume all dependencies are installed, but if not, refer to the dependencies section below)
3. Export as .docx using Packer.toBuffer()

## Editing an existing Word document

When editing an existing Word document, use the **Document library** (a Python library for OOXML manipulation). The library automatically handles infrastructure setup and provides methods for document manipulation. For complex scenarios, you can access the underlying DOM directly through the library.

### Workflow
1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for the Document library API and XML patterns for directly editing document files.
2. Unpack the document: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`
3. Create and run a Python script using the Document library (see "Document Library" section in ooxml.md)
4. Pack the final document: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`

The Document library provides both high-level methods for common operations and direct DOM access for complex scenarios.

## Redlining workflow for document review

This workflow allows you to plan comprehensive tracked changes using markdown before implementing them in OOXML. **CRITICAL**: For complete tracked changes, you must implement ALL changes systematically.

**Batching Strategy**: Group related changes into batches of 3-10 changes. This makes debugging manageable while maintaining efficiency. Test each batch before moving to the next.

**Principle: Minimal, Precise Edits**
When implementing tracked changes, only mark text that actually changes. Repeating unchanged text makes edits harder to review and appears unprofessional. Break replacements into: [unchanged text] + [deletion] + [insertion] + [unchanged text]. Preserve the original run''s RSID for unchanged text by extracting the `<w:r>` element from the original and reusing it.

Example - Changing "30 days" to "60 days" in a sentence:
```python
# BAD - Replaces entire sentence
''<w:del><w:r><w:delText>The term is 30 days.</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>The term is 60 days.</w:t></w:r></w:ins>''

# GOOD - Only marks what changed, preserves original <w:r> for unchanged text
''<w:r w:rsidR="00AB12CD"><w:t>The term is </w:t></w:r><w:del><w:r><w:delText>30</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>60</w:t></w:r></w:ins><w:r w:rsidR="00AB12CD"><w:t> days.</w:t></w:r>''
```

### Tracked changes workflow

1. **Get markdown representation**: Convert document to markdown with tracked changes preserved:
   ```bash
   pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o current.md
   ```

2. **Identify and group changes**: Review the document and identify ALL changes needed, organizing them into logical batches:

   **Location methods** (for finding changes in XML):
   - Section/heading numbers (e.g., "Section 3.2", "Article IV")
   - Paragraph identifiers if numbered
   - Grep patterns with unique surrounding text
   - Document structure (e.g., "first paragraph", "signature block")
   - **DO NOT use markdown line numbers** - they don''t map to XML structure

   **Batch organization** (group 3-10 related changes per batch):
   - By section: "Batch 1: Section 2 amendments", "Batch 2: Section 5 updates"
   - By type: "Batch 1: Date corrections", "Batch 2: Party name changes"
   - By complexity: Start with simple text replacements, then tackle complex structural changes
   - Sequential: "Batch 1: Pages 1-3", "Batch 2: Pages 4-6"

3. **Read documentation and unpack**:
   - **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Pay special attention to the "Document Library" and "Tracked Change Patterns" sections.
   - **Unpack the document**: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <file.docx> <dir>`
   - **Note the suggested RSID**: The unpack script will suggest an RSID to use for your tracked changes. Copy this RSID for use in step 4b.

4. **Implement changes in batches**: Group changes logically (by section, by type, or by proximity) and implement them together in a single script. This approach:
   - Makes debugging easier (smaller batch = easier to isolate errors)
   - Allows incremental progress
   - Maintains efficiency (batch size of 3-10 changes works well)

   **Suggested batch groupings:**
   - By document section (e.g., "Section 3 changes", "Definitions", "Termination clause")
   - By change type (e.g., "Date changes", "Party name updates", "Legal term replacements")
   - By proximity (e.g., "Changes on pages 1-3", "Changes in first half of document")

   For each batch of related changes:

   **a. Map text to XML**: Grep for text in `word/document.xml` to verify how text is split across `<w:r>` elements.

   **b. Create and run script**: Use `get_node` to find nodes, implement changes, then `doc.save()`. See **"Document Library"** section in ooxml.md for patterns.

   **Note**: Always grep `word/document.xml` immediately before writing a script to get current line numbers and verify text content. Line numbers change after each script run.

5. **Pack the document**: After all batches are complete, convert the unpacked directory back to .docx:
   ```bash
   python ooxml/scripts/pack.py unpacked reviewed-document.docx
   ```

6. **Final verification**: Do a comprehensive check of the complete document:
   - Convert final document to markdown:
     ```bash
     pandoc --track-changes=all reviewed-document.docx -o verification.md
     ```
   - Verify ALL changes were applied correctly:
     ```bash
     grep "original phrase" verification.md  # Should NOT find it
     grep "replacement phrase" verification.md  # Should find it
     ```
   - Check that no unintended changes were introduced


## Converting Documents to Images

To visually analyze Word documents, convert them to images using a two-step process:

1. **Convert DOCX to PDF**:
   ```bash
   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf document.docx
   ```

2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**:
   ```bash
   pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 document.pdf page
   ```
   This creates files like `page-1.jpg`, `page-2.jpg`, etc.

Options:
- `-r 150`: Sets resolution to 150 DPI (adjust for quality/size balance)
- `-jpeg`: Output JPEG format (use `-png` for PNG if preferred)
- `-f N`: First page to convert (e.g., `-f 2` starts from page 2)
- `-l N`: Last page to convert (e.g., `-l 5` stops at page 5)
- `page`: Prefix for output files

Example for specific range:
```bash
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f 2 -l 5 document.pdf page  # Converts only pages 2-5
```

## Code Style Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: When generating code for DOCX operations:
- Write concise code
- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations
- Avoid unnecessary print statements

## Dependencies

Required dependencies (install if not available):

- **pandoc**: `sudo apt-get install pandoc` (for text extraction)
- **docx**: `npm install -g docx` (for creating new documents)
- **LibreOffice**: `sudo apt-get install libreoffice` (for PDF conversion)
- **Poppler**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils` (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images)
- **defusedxml**: `pip install defusedxml` (for secure XML parsing)', '{"name": "docx", "description": "Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction.

# Email Sequence Design

You are an expert in email marketing and automation. Your goal is to create email sequences that nurture relationships, drive action, and move people toward conversion.

## Initial Assessment

Before creating a sequence, understand:

1. **Sequence Type**
   - Welcome/onboarding sequence
   - Lead nurture sequence
   - Re-engagement sequence
   - Post-purchase sequence
   - Event-based sequence
   - Educational sequence
   - Sales sequence

2. **Audience Context**
   - Who are they?
   - What triggered them into this sequence?
   - What do they already know/believe?
   - What''s their current relationship with you?

3. **Goals**
   - Primary conversion goal
   - Relationship-building goals
   - Segmentation goals
   - What defines success?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. One Email, One Job
- Each email has one primary purpose
- One main CTA per email
- Don''t try to do everything

### 2. Value Before Ask
- Lead with usefulness
- Build trust through content
- Earn the right to sell

### 3. Relevance Over Volume
- Fewer, better emails win
- Segment for relevance
- Quality > frequency

### 4. Clear Path Forward
- Every email moves them somewhere
- Links should do something useful
- Make next steps obvious

---

## Email Sequence Strategy

### Sequence Length
- Welcome: 3-7 emails
- Lead nurture: 5-10 emails
- Onboarding: 5-10 emails
- Re-engagement: 3-5 emails

Depends on:
- Sales cycle length
- Product complexity
- Relationship stage

### Timing/Delays
- Welcome email: Immediately
- Early sequence: 1-2 days apart
- Nurture: 2-4 days apart
- Long-term: Weekly or bi-weekly

Consider:
- B2B: Avoid weekends
- B2C: Test weekends
- Time zones: Send at local time

### Subject Line Strategy
- Clear > Clever
- Specific > Vague
- Benefit or curiosity-driven
- 40-60 characters ideal
- Test emoji (they''re polarizing)

**Patterns that work:**
- Question: "Still struggling with X?"
- How-to: "How to [achieve outcome] in [timeframe]"
- Number: "3 ways to [benefit]"
- Direct: "[First name], your [thing] is ready"
- Story tease: "The mistake I made with [topic]"

### Preview Text
- Extends the subject line
- ~90-140 characters
- Don''t repeat subject line
- Complete the thought or add intrigue

## Email Copy Guidelines

### Structure
1. **Hook**: First line grabs attention
2. **Context**: Why this matters to them
3. **Value**: The useful content
4. **CTA**: What to do next
5. **Sign-off**: Human, warm close

### Formatting
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- White space between sections
- Bullet points for scanability
- Bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- Mobile-first (most read on phone)

### Tone
- Conversational, not formal
- First-person (I/we) and second-person (you)
- Active voice
- Match your brand but lean friendly
- Read it out loud—does it sound human?

### Length
- Shorter is usually better
- 50-125 words for transactional
- 150-300 words for educational
- 300-500 words for story-driven
- If it''s long, it better be good

### CTA Buttons vs. Links

# Form CRO

You are an expert in form optimization. Your goal is to maximize form completion rates while capturing the data that matters.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, identify:

1. **Form Type**
   - Lead capture (gated content, newsletter)
   - Contact form
   - Demo/sales request
   - Application form
   - Survey/feedback
   - Checkout form
   - Quote request

2. **Current State**
   - How many fields?
   - What''s the current completion rate?
   - Mobile vs. desktop split?
   - Where do users abandon?

3. **Business Context**
   - What happens with form submissions?
   - Which fields are actually used in follow-up?
   - Are there compliance/legal requirements?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Every Field Has a Cost
Each field reduces completion rate. Rule of thumb:
- 3 fields: Baseline
- 4-6 fields: 10-25% reduction
- 7+ fields: 25-50%+ reduction

For each field, ask:
- Is this absolutely necessary before we can help them?
- Can we get this information another way?
- Can we ask this later?

### 2. Value Must Exceed Effort
- Clear value proposition above form
- Make what they get obvious
- Reduce perceived effort (field count, labels)

### 3. Reduce Cognitive Load
- One question per field
- Clear, conversational labels
- Logical grouping and order
- Smart defaults where possible

---

## Field-by-Field Optimization

### Email Field
- Single field, no confirmation
- Inline validation
- Typo detection (did you mean gmail.com?)
- Proper mobile keyboard

### Name Fields
- Single "Name" vs. First/Last — test this
- Single field reduces friction
- Split needed only if personalization requires it

### Phone Number
- Make optional if possible
- If required, explain why
- Auto-format as they type
- Country code handling

### Company/Organization
- Auto-suggest for faster entry
- Enrichment after submission (Clearbit, etc.)
- Consider inferring from email domain

### Job Title/Role
- Dropdown if categories matter
- Free text if wide variation
- Consider making optional

### Message/Comments (Free Text)
- Make optional
- Reasonable character guidance
- Expand on focus

### Dropdown Selects
- "Select one..." placeholder
- Searchable if many options
- Consider radio buttons if < 5 options
- "Other" option with text field

### Checkboxes (Multi-select)
- Clear, parallel labels
- Reasonable number of options
- Consider "Select all that apply" instruction

---

## Form Layout Optimization

### Field Order
1. Start with easiest fields (name, email)
2. Build commitment before asking more
3. Sensitive fields last (phone, company size)
4. Logical grouping if many fields

### Labels and Placeholders
- Labels: Always visible (not just placeholder)
- Placeholders: Examples, not labels
- Help text: Only when genuinely helpful

**Good:**
```
Email
[name@company.com]
```

**Bad:**
```
[Enter your email address]  ← Disappears on focus
```

### Visual Design
- Sufficient spacing between fields
- Clear visual hierarchy
- CTA button stands out
- Mobile-friendly tap targets (44px+)

### Single Column vs. Multi-Column
- Single column: Higher completion, mobile-friendly
- Multi-column: Only for short related fields (First/Last name)
- When in doubt, single column

---

## Multi-Step Forms

### When to Use Multi-Step
- More than 5-6 fields
- Logically distinct sections
- Conditional paths based on answers
- Complex forms (applications, quotes)

### Multi-Step Best Practices
- Progress indicator (step X of Y)
- Start with easy, end with sensitive
- One topic per step
- Allow back navigation
- Save progress (don''t lose data on refresh)
- Clear indication of required vs. optional

### Progressive Commitment Pattern
1. Low-friction start (just email)
2. More detail (name, company)
3. Qualifying questions
4. Contact preferences

---

## Error Handling

### Inline Validation
- Validate as they move to next field
- Don''t validate too aggressively while typing
- Clear visual indicators (green check, red border)

### Error Messages
- Specific to the problem
- Suggest how to fix
- Positioned near the field
- Don''t clear their input

**Good:** "Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@company.com)"
**Bad:** "Invalid input"

### On Submit
- Focus on first error field
- Summarize errors if multiple
- Preserve all entered data
- Don''t clear form on error

---

## Submit Button Optimization

### Button Copy
Weak: "Submit" | "Send"
Strong: "[Action] + [What they get]"

Examples:
- "Get My Free Quote"
- "Download the Guide"
- "Request Demo"
- "Send Message"
- "Start Free Trial"

### Button Placement
- Immediately after last field
- Left-aligned with fields
- Sufficient size and contrast
- Mobile: Sticky or clearly visible

### Post-Submit States
- Loading state (disable button, show spinner)
- Success confirmation (clear next steps)
- Error handling (clear message, focus on issue)

---

## Trust and Friction Reduction

### Near the Form
- Privacy statement: "We''ll never share your info"
- Security badges if collecting sensitive data
- Testimonial or social proof
- Expected response time

### Reducing Perceived Effort
- "Takes 30 seconds"
- Field count indicator
- Remove visual clutter
- Generous white space

### Addressing Objections
- "No spam, unsubscribe anytime"
- "We won''t share your number"
- "No credit card required"

---

## Form Types: Specific Guidance

### Lead Capture (Gated Content)
- Minimum viable fields (often just email)
- Clear value proposition for what they get
- Consider asking enrichment questions post-download
- Test email-only vs. email + name

### Contact Form
- Essential: Email/Name + Message
- Phone optional
- Set response time expectations
- Offer alternatives (chat, phone)

### Demo Request
- Name, Email, Company required
- Phone: Optional with "preferred contact" choice
- Use case/goal question helps personalize
- Calendar embed can increase show rate

### Quote/Estimate Request
- Multi-step often works well
- Start with easy questions
- Technical details later
- Save progress for complex forms

### Survey Forms
- Progress bar essential
- One question per screen for engagement
- Skip logic for relevance
- Consider incentive for completion

---

## Mobile Optimization

- Larger touch targets (44px minimum height)
- Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, number)
- Autofill support
- Single column only
- Sticky submit button
- Minimal typing (dropdowns, buttons)

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics
- **Form start rate**: Page views → Started form
- **Completion rate**: Started → Submitted
- **Field drop-off**: Which fields lose people
- **Error rate**: By field
- **Time to complete**: Total and by field
- **Mobile vs. desktop**: Completion by device

### What to Track

## SEO Considerations

### Keyword Strategy

**Tool landing page:**
- "[thing] calculator"
- "[thing] generator"
- "free [tool type]"
- "[industry] [tool type]"

**Supporting content:**
- "How to [use case]"
- "What is [concept tool helps with]"
- Blog posts that link to tool

### Link Building

Free tools attract links because:
- Genuinely useful (people reference them)
- Unique (can''t link to just any page)
- Shareable (social amplification)

**Outreach opportunities:**
- Roundup posts ("best free tools for X")

- Risk: Lower usage

**Partially gated (email for full results):**
- Show preview, gate details
- Better balance
- Most common pattern

**Ungated with optional capture:**
- Tool is free to use
- Email to save/share results
- Highest usage, lower capture

**Ungated entirely:**
- Pure SEO/brand play
- No direct leads
- Maximum reach

### Lead Capture Best Practices

- Value exchange clear: "Get your full report"
- Minimal friction: Email only
- Show preview of what they''ll get
- Optional: Segment by asking one qualifying question

### Post-Capture

- Immediate email with results/link
- Nurture sequence relevant to tool topic

# HTML to PDF Converter

Pixel-perfect HTML to PDF conversion using Puppeteer (Chrome headless). Provides excellent support for Hebrew, Arabic, and other RTL languages with automatic direction detection.

## Why Puppeteer?

- **Pixel-perfect rendering**: Uses actual Chrome engine
- **Full CSS3/HTML5 support**: Flexbox, Grid, custom fonts, backgrounds
- **JavaScript execution**: Renders dynamic content
- **Automatic RTL detection**: Detects Hebrew/Arabic and sets direction
- **Web font support**: Loads custom fonts properly

## CRITICAL: Fit Content to Single Page

**Backgrounds on `html` or `body` cause extra pages!** Put backgrounds on a container element instead:

```css
@page { size: A4; margin: 0; }

html, body {
  width: 210mm;
  height: 297mm;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  /* NO background here! */
}

.container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 20mm;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  background: linear-gradient(...); /* Background goes HERE */
}
```

**Common causes of extra pages:**
1. **Background on html/body** - always put on `.container` instead
2. Content overflow - use `overflow: hidden`
3. Margins/padding pushing content out

**Tips:**
- Use `--scale=0.75 --margin=0` if content still overflows
- For landscape: use `--landscape`

## Hebrew/RTL Best Practices

For best Hebrew rendering in your HTML:

1. **Set lang attribute**: `<html lang="he" dir="rtl">`
2. **Use UTF-8**: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
3. **CSS direction**: Add `direction: rtl; text-align: right;` to body
4. **Fonts**: Use web fonts that support Hebrew (Noto Sans Hebrew, Heebo, Assistant)

### Example Hebrew HTML structure (single-page):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="he" dir="rtl">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Heebo:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <style>
    @page { size: A4; margin: 0; }
    html, body {
      width: 210mm;
      height: 297mm;
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      overflow: hidden;
    }
    .container {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      padding: 20mm;
      box-sizing: border-box;
      font-family: ''Heebo'', sans-serif;
      direction: rtl;
      text-align: right;
      background: #f5f5f5; /* Background on container, NOT body */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>שלום עולם</h1>
    <p>זהו מסמך בעברית</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fonts not rendering correctly
- Add `--wait=2000` for more font loading time
- Ensure fonts are loaded via `@font-face` or Google Fonts

### Hebrew appearing left-to-right
- Use `--rtl` flag to force RTL direction
- Add `dir="rtl"` to your HTML element

### Page breaks not working
Use CSS page-break properties:
```css
.page-break { page-break-after: always; }
.no-break { page-break-inside: avoid; }
```

### Backgrounds not showing
- Ensure `--background` is set (default is true)
- Use `--no-background` only if you want to exclude backgrounds

## Technical Notes

- Uses Puppeteer with Chrome headless for rendering
- Waits for `networkidle0` to ensure all resources load
- Automatically waits for `document.fonts.ready`
- Supports `@page` CSS rules for print styling
- Device scale factor set to 2 for crisp rendering

# Launch Strategy

You are an expert in SaaS product launches and feature announcements. Your goal is to help users plan launches that build momentum, capture attention, and convert interest into users.

## Core Philosophy

The best companies don''t just launch once—they launch again and again. Every new feature, improvement, and update is an opportunity to capture attention and engage your audience.

A strong launch isn''t about a single moment. It''s about:
- Getting your product into users'' hands early
- Learning from real feedback
- Making a splash at every stage
- Building momentum that compounds over time

---

## The ORB Framework

Structure your launch marketing across three channel types. Everything should ultimately lead back to owned channels.

### Owned Channels
You own the channel (though not the audience). Direct access without algorithms or platform rules.

**Examples:**
- Email list
- Blog
- Podcast
- Branded community (Slack, Discord)
- Website/product

**Why they matter:**
- Get more effective over time
- No algorithm changes or pay-to-play
- Direct relationship with audience
- Compound value from content

**Start with 1-2 based on audience:**
- Industry lacks quality content → Start a blog
- People want direct updates → Focus on email
- Engagement matters → Build a community

**Example - Superhuman:**
Built demand through an invite-only waitlist and one-on-one onboarding sessions. Every new user got a 30-minute live demo. This created exclusivity, FOMO, and word-of-mouth—all through owned relationships. Years later, their original onboarding materials still drive engagement.

### Rented Channels
Platforms that provide visibility but you don''t control. Algorithms shift, rules change, pay-to-play increases.

**Examples:**
- Social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- App stores and marketplaces
- YouTube
- Reddit

**How to use correctly:**
- Pick 1-2 platforms where your audience is active
- Use them to drive traffic to owned channels
- Don''t rely on them as your only strategy

**Example - Notion:**
Hacked virality through Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit where productivity enthusiasts were active. Encouraged community to share templates and workflows. But they funneled all visibility into owned assets—every viral post led to signups, then targeted email onboarding.

**Platform-specific tactics:**
- Twitter/X: Threads that spark conversation → link to newsletter
- LinkedIn: High-value posts → lead to gated content or email signup
- Marketplaces (Shopify, Slack): Optimize listing → drive to site for more

Rented channels give speed, not stability. Capture momentum by bringing users into your owned ecosystem.

### Borrowed Channels
Tap into someone else''s audience to shortcut the hardest part—getting noticed.

**Examples:**
- Guest content (blog posts, podcast interviews, newsletter features)
- Collaborations (webinars, co-marketing, social takeovers)
- Speaking engagements (conferences, panels, virtual summits)
- Influencer partnerships

**Be proactive, not passive:**
1. List industry leaders your audience follows
2. Pitch win-win collaborations
3. Use tools like SparkToro or Listen Notes to find audience overlap
4. Set up affiliate/referral incentives

**Example - TRMNL:**
Sent a free e-ink display to YouTuber Snazzy Labs—not a paid sponsorship, just hoping he''d like it. He created an in-depth review that racked up 500K+ views and drove $500K+ in sales. They also set up an affiliate program for ongoing promotion.

Borrowed channels give instant credibility, but only work if you convert borrowed attention into owned relationships.

## Five-Phase Launch Approach

Launching isn''t a one-day event. It''s a phased process that builds momentum.

### Phase 1: Internal Launch
Gather initial feedback and iron out major issues before going public.

**Actions:**
- Recruit early users one-on-one to test for free
- Collect feedback on usability gaps and missing features
- Ensure prototype is functional enough to demo (doesn''t need to be production-ready)

**Goal:** Validate core functionality with friendly users.

### Phase 2: Alpha Launch
Put the product in front of external users in a controlled way.

**Actions:**
- Create landing page with early access signup form
- Announce the product exists
- Invite users individually to start testing
- MVP should be working in production (even if still evolving)

**Goal:** First external validation and initial waitlist building.

### Phase 3: Beta Launch
Scale up early access while generating external buzz.

**Actions:**
- Work through early access list (some free, some paid)
- Start marketing with teasers about problems you solve
- Recruit friends, investors, and influencers to test and share

**Consider adding:**
- Coming soon landing page or waitlist
- "Beta" sticker in dashboard navigation
- Email invites to early access list
- Early access toggle in settings for experimental features

**Goal:** Build buzz and refine product with broader feedback.

### Phase 4: Early Access Launch
Shift from small-scale testing to controlled expansion.

**Actions:**
- Leak product details: screenshots, feature GIFs, demos
- Gather quantitative usage data and qualitative feedback
- Run user research with engaged users (incentivize with credits)
- Optionally run product/market fit survey to refine messaging

**Expansion options:**
- Option A: Throttle invites in batches (5-10% at a time)
- Option B: Invite all users at once under "early access" framing

**Goal:** Validate at scale and prepare for full launch.

### Phase 5: Full Launch
Open the floodgates.

**Actions:**
- Open self-serve signups
- Start charging (if not already)
- Announce general availability across all channels

**Launch touchpoints:**
- Customer emails
- In-app popups and product tours
- Website banner linking to launch assets
- "New" sticker in dashboard navigation
- Blog post announcement
- Social posts across platforms
- Product Hunt, BetaList, Hacker News, etc.

**Goal:** Maximum visibility and conversion to paying users.

## Product Hunt Launch Strategy

Product Hunt can be powerful for reaching early adopters, but it''s not magic—it requires preparation.

### Pros
- Exposure to tech-savvy early adopter audience
- Credibility bump (especially if Product of the Day)
- Potential PR coverage and backlinks

### Cons
- Very competitive to rank well
- Short-lived traffic spikes
- Requires significant pre-launch planning

### How to Launch Successfully

**Before launch day:**
1. Build relationships with influential supporters, content hubs, and communities
2. Optimize your listing: compelling tagline, polished visuals, short demo video
3. Study successful launches to identify what worked
4. Engage in relevant communities—provide value before pitching
5. Prepare your team for all-day engagement

**On launch day:**
1. Treat it as an all-day event
2. Respond to every comment in real-time
3. Answer questions and spark discussions
4. Encourage your existing audience to engage
5. Direct traffic back to your site to capture signups

**After launch day:**
1. Follow up with everyone who engaged
2. Convert Product Hunt traffic into owned relationships (email signups)
3. Continue momentum with post-launch content

### Case Studies

**SavvyCal** (Scheduling tool):
- Optimized landing page and onboarding before launch
- Built relationships with productivity/SaaS influencers in advance
- Responded to every comment on launch day
- Result: #2 Product of the Month

**Reform** (Form builder):
- Studied successful launches and applied insights
- Crafted clear tagline, polished visuals, demo video
- Engaged in communities before launch (provided value first)
- Treated launch as all-day engagement event
- Directed traffic to capture signups
- Result: #1 Product of the Day

---

## Post-Launch Product Marketing

Your launch isn''t over when the announcement goes live. Now comes adoption and retention work.

### Immediate Post-Launch Actions

**Educate new users:**
Set up automated onboarding email sequence introducing key features and use cases.

**Reinforce the launch:**
Include announcement in your weekly/biweekly/monthly roundup email to catch people who missed it.

**Differentiate against competitors:**
Publish comparison pages highlighting why you''re the obvious choice.

**Update web pages:**
Add dedicated sections about the new feature/product across your site.

**Offer hands-on preview:**
Create no-code interactive demo (using tools like Navattic) so visitors can explore before signing up.

### Keep Momentum Going
It''s easier to build on existing momentum than start from scratch. Every touchpoint reinforces the launch.

---

## Ongoing Launch Strategy

Don''t rely on a single launch event. Regular updates and feature rollouts sustain engagement.

### How to Prioritize What to Announce

Use this matrix to decide how much marketing each update deserves:

**Major updates** (new features, product overhauls):
- Full campaign across multiple channels
- Blog post, email campaign, in-app messages, social media
- Maximize exposure

**Medium updates** (new integrations, UI enhancements):
- Targeted announcement
- Email to relevant segments, in-app banner
- Don''t need full fanfare

**Minor updates** (bug fixes, small tweaks):
- Changelog and release notes
- Signal that product is improving
- Don''t dominate marketing

### Announcement Tactics

**Space out releases:**
Instead of shipping everything at once, stagger announcements to maintain momentum.

**Reuse high-performing tactics:**
If a previous announcement resonated, apply those insights to future updates.

**Keep engaging:**
Continue using email, social, and in-app messaging to highlight improvements.

**Signal active development:**
Even small changelog updates remind customers your product is evolving. This builds retention and word-of-mouth—customers feel confident you''ll be around.

# Marketing Psychology & Mental Models

You are an expert in applying psychological principles and mental models to marketing. Your goal is to help users understand why people buy, how to influence behavior ethically, and how to make better marketing decisions.

## How to Use This Skill

Mental models are thinking tools that help you make better decisions, understand customer behavior, and create more effective marketing. When helping users:

1. Identify which mental models apply to their situation
2. Explain the psychology behind the model
3. Provide specific marketing applications
4. Suggest how to implement ethically

---

## Foundational Thinking Models

These models sharpen your strategy and help you solve the right problems.

### First Principles
Break problems down to basic truths and build solutions from there. Instead of copying competitors, ask "why" repeatedly to find root causes. Use the 5 Whys technique to tunnel down to what really matters.

**Marketing application**: Don''t assume you need content marketing because competitors do. Ask why you need it, what problem it solves, and whether there''s a better solution.

### Jobs to Be Done
People don''t buy products—they "hire" them to get a job done. Focus on the outcome customers want, not features.

**Marketing application**: A drill buyer doesn''t want a drill—they want a hole. Frame your product around the job it accomplishes, not its specifications.

### Circle of Competence
Know what you''re good at and stay within it. Venture outside only with proper learning or expert help.

**Marketing application**: Don''t chase every channel. Double down where you have genuine expertise and competitive advantage.

### Inversion
Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "What would guarantee failure?" Then avoid those things.

**Marketing application**: List everything that would make your campaign fail—confusing messaging, wrong audience, slow landing page—then systematically prevent each.

### Occam''s Razor
The simplest explanation is usually correct. Avoid overcomplicating strategies or attributing results to complex causes when simple ones suffice.

**Marketing application**: If conversions dropped, check the obvious first (broken form, page speed) before assuming complex attribution issues.

### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
Roughly 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Identify and focus on the vital few.

**Marketing application**: Find the 20% of channels, customers, or content driving 80% of results. Cut or reduce the rest.

### Local vs. Global Optima
A local optimum is the best solution nearby, but a global optimum is the best overall. Don''t get stuck optimizing the wrong thing.

**Marketing application**: Optimizing email subject lines (local) won''t help if email isn''t the right channel (global). Zoom out before zooming in.

### Theory of Constraints
Every system has one bottleneck limiting throughput. Find and fix that constraint before optimizing elsewhere.

**Marketing application**: If your funnel converts well but traffic is low, more conversion optimization won''t help. Fix the traffic bottleneck first.

### Opportunity Cost
Every choice has a cost—what you give up by not choosing alternatives. Consider what you''re saying no to.

**Marketing application**: Time spent on a low-ROI channel is time not spent on high-ROI activities. Always compare against alternatives.

### Law of Diminishing Returns
After a point, additional investment yields progressively smaller gains.

**Marketing application**: The 10th blog post won''t have the same impact as the first. Know when to diversify rather than double down.

### Second-Order Thinking
Consider not just immediate effects, but the effects of those effects.

**Marketing application**: A flash sale boosts revenue (first order) but may train customers to wait for discounts (second order).

### Map ≠ Territory
Models and data represent reality but aren''t reality itself. Don''t confuse your analytics dashboard with actual customer experience.

**Marketing application**: Your customer persona is a useful model, but real customers are more complex. Stay in touch with actual users.

### Probabilistic Thinking
Think in probabilities, not certainties. Estimate likelihoods and plan for multiple outcomes.

**Marketing application**: Don''t bet everything on one campaign. Spread risk and plan for scenarios where your primary strategy underperforms.

### Barbell Strategy
Combine extreme safety with small high-risk/high-reward bets. Avoid the mediocre middle.

**Marketing application**: Put 80% of budget into proven channels, 20% into experimental bets. Avoid moderate-risk, moderate-reward middle.

---

## Understanding Buyers & Human Psychology

These models explain how customers think, decide, and behave.

### Fundamental Attribution Error
People attribute others'' behavior to character, not circumstances. "They didn''t buy because they''re not serious" vs. "The checkout was confusing."

**Marketing application**: When customers don''t convert, examine your process before blaming them. The problem is usually situational, not personal.

### Mere Exposure Effect
People prefer things they''ve seen before. Familiarity breeds liking.

**Marketing application**: Consistent brand presence builds preference over time. Repetition across channels creates comfort and trust.

### Availability Heuristic
People judge likelihood by how easily examples come to mind. Recent or vivid events seem more common.

**Marketing application**: Case studies and testimonials make success feel more achievable. Make positive outcomes easy to imagine.

### Confirmation Bias
People seek information confirming existing beliefs and ignore contradictory evidence.

**Marketing application**: Understand what your audience already believes and align messaging accordingly. Fighting beliefs head-on rarely works.

### The Lindy Effect
The longer something has survived, the longer it''s likely to continue. Old ideas often outlast new ones.

**Marketing application**: Proven marketing principles (clear value props, social proof) outlast trendy tactics. Don''t abandon fundamentals for fads.

### Mimetic Desire
People want things because others want them. Desire is socially contagious.

**Marketing application**: Show that desirable people want your product. Waitlists, exclusivity, and social proof trigger mimetic desire.

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
People continue investing in something because of past investment, even when it''s no longer rational.

**Marketing application**: Know when to kill underperforming campaigns. Past spend shouldn''t justify future spend if results aren''t there.

### Endowment Effect
People value things more once they own them.

**Marketing application**: Free trials, samples, and freemium models let customers "own" the product, making them reluctant to give it up.

### IKEA Effect
People value things more when they''ve put effort into creating them.

**Marketing application**: Let customers customize, configure, or build something. Their investment increases perceived value and commitment.

### Zero-Price Effect
Free isn''t just a low price—it''s psychologically different. "Free" triggers irrational preference.

**Marketing application**: Free tiers, free trials, and free shipping have disproportionate appeal. The jump from $1 to $0 is bigger than $2 to $1.

### Hyperbolic Discounting / Present Bias
People strongly prefer immediate rewards over future ones, even when waiting is more rational.

**Marketing application**: Emphasize immediate benefits ("Start saving time today") over future ones ("You''ll see ROI in 6 months").

### Status-Quo Bias
People prefer the current state of affairs. Change requires effort and feels risky.

**Marketing application**: Reduce friction to switch. Make the transition feel safe and easy. "Import your data in one click."

### Default Effect
People tend to accept pre-selected options. Defaults are powerful.

**Marketing application**: Pre-select the plan you want customers to choose. Opt-out beats opt-in for subscriptions (ethically applied).

### Paradox of Choice
Too many options overwhelm and paralyze. Fewer choices often lead to more decisions.

**Marketing application**: Limit options. Three pricing tiers beat seven. Recommend a single "best for most" option.

### Goal-Gradient Effect
People accelerate effort as they approach a goal. Progress visualization motivates action.

**Marketing application**: Show progress bars, completion percentages, and "almost there" messaging to drive completion.

### Peak-End Rule
People judge experiences by the peak (best or worst moment) and the end, not the average.

**Marketing application**: Design memorable peaks (surprise upgrades, delightful moments) and strong endings (thank you pages, follow-up emails).

### Zeigarnik Effect
Unfinished tasks occupy the mind more than completed ones. Open loops create tension.

**Marketing application**: "You''re 80% done" creates pull to finish. Incomplete profiles, abandoned carts, and cliffhangers leverage this.

### Pratfall Effect
Competent people become more likable when they show a small flaw. Perfection is less relatable.

**Marketing application**: Admitting a weakness ("We''re not the cheapest, but...") can increase trust and differentiation.

### Curse of Knowledge
Once you know something, you can''t imagine not knowing it. Experts struggle to explain simply.

**Marketing application**: Your product seems obvious to you but confusing to newcomers. Test copy with people unfamiliar with your space.

### Mental Accounting
People treat money differently based on its source or intended use, even though money is fungible.

**Marketing application**: Frame costs in favorable mental accounts. "$3/day" feels different than "$90/month" even though it''s the same.

### Regret Aversion
People avoid actions that might cause regret, even if the expected outcome is positive.

**Marketing application**: Address regret directly. Money-back guarantees, free trials, and "no commitment" messaging reduce regret fear.

### Bandwagon Effect / Social Proof
People follow what others are doing. Popularity signals quality and safety.

**Marketing application**: Show customer counts, testimonials, logos, reviews, and "trending" indicators. Numbers create confidence.

---

## Influencing Behavior & Persuasion

These models help you ethically influence customer decisions.

### Reciprocity Principle
People feel obligated to return favors. Give first, and people want to give back.

**Marketing application**: Free content, free tools, and generous free tiers create reciprocal obligation. Give value before asking for anything.

### Commitment & Consistency
Once people commit to something, they want to stay consistent with that commitment.

**Marketing application**: Get small commitments first (email signup, free trial). People who''ve taken one step are more likely to take the next.

### Authority Bias
People defer to experts and authority figures. Credentials and expertise create trust.

**Marketing application**: Feature expert endorsements, certifications, "featured in" logos, and thought leadership content.

### Liking / Similarity Bias
People say yes to those they like and those similar to themselves.

**Marketing application**: Use relatable spokespeople, founder stories, and community language. "Built by marketers for marketers" signals similarity.

### Unity Principle
Shared identity drives influence. "One of us" is powerful.

**Marketing application**: Position your brand as part of the customer''s tribe. Use insider language and shared values.

### Scarcity / Urgency Heuristic
Limited availability increases perceived value. Scarcity signals desirability.

**Marketing application**: Limited-time offers, low-stock warnings, and exclusive access create urgency. Only use when genuine.

### Foot-in-the-Door Technique
Start with a small request, then escalate. Compliance with small requests leads to compliance with larger ones.

**Marketing application**: Free trial → paid plan → annual plan → enterprise. Each step builds on the last.

### Door-in-the-Face Technique
Start with an unreasonably large request, then retreat to what you actually want. The contrast makes the second request seem reasonable.

**Marketing application**: Show enterprise pricing first, then reveal the affordable starter plan. The contrast makes it feel like a deal.

### Loss Aversion / Prospect Theory
Losses feel roughly twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good. People will work harder to avoid losing than to gain.

**Marketing application**: Frame in terms of what they''ll lose by not acting. "Don''t miss out" beats "You could gain."

### Anchoring Effect
The first number people see heavily influences subsequent judgments.

**Marketing application**: Show the higher price first (original price, competitor price, enterprise tier) to anchor expectations.

### Decoy Effect
Adding a third, inferior option makes one of the original two look better.

**Marketing application**: A "decoy" pricing tier that''s clearly worse value makes your preferred tier look like the obvious choice.

### Framing Effect
How something is presented changes how it''s perceived. Same facts, different frames.

**Marketing application**: "90% success rate" vs. "10% failure rate" are identical but feel different. Frame positively.

### Contrast Effect
Things seem different depending on what they''re compared to.

**Marketing application**: Show the "before" state clearly. The contrast with your "after" makes improvements vivid.

---

## Pricing Psychology

These models specifically address how people perceive and respond to prices.

### Charm Pricing / Left-Digit Effect
Prices ending in 9 seem significantly lower than the next round number. $99 feels much cheaper than $100.

**Marketing application**: Use .99 or .95 endings for value-focused products. The left digit dominates perception.

### Rounded-Price (Fluency) Effect
Round numbers feel premium and are easier to process. $100 signals quality; $99 signals value.

**Marketing application**: Use round prices for premium products ($500/month), charm prices for value products ($497/month).

### Rule of 100
For prices under $100, percentage discounts seem larger ("20% off"). For prices over $100, absolute discounts seem larger ("$50 off").

**Marketing application**: $80 product: "20% off" beats "$16 off." $500 product: "$100 off" beats "20% off."

### Price Relativity / Good-Better-Best
People judge prices relative to options presented. A middle tier seems reasonable between cheap and expensive.

**Marketing application**: Three tiers where the middle is your target. The expensive tier makes it look reasonable; the cheap tier provides an anchor.

### Mental Accounting (Pricing)
Framing the same price differently changes perception.

**Marketing application**: "$1/day" feels cheaper than "$30/month." "Less than your morning coffee" reframes the expense.

---

## Design & Delivery Models

These models help you design effective marketing systems.

### Hick''s Law
Decision time increases with the number and complexity of choices. More options = slower decisions = more abandonment.

**Marketing application**: Simplify choices. One clear CTA beats three. Fewer form fields beat more.

### AIDA Funnel
Attention → Interest → Desire → Action. The classic customer journey model.

**Marketing application**: Structure pages and campaigns to move through each stage. Capture attention before building desire.

### Rule of 7
Prospects need roughly 7 touchpoints before converting. One ad rarely converts; sustained presence does.

**Marketing application**: Build multi-touch campaigns across channels. Retargeting, email sequences, and consistent presence compound.

### Nudge Theory / Choice Architecture
Small changes in how choices are presented significantly influence decisions.

**Marketing application**: Default selections, strategic ordering, and friction reduction guide behavior without restricting choice.

### BJ Fogg Behavior Model
Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt. All three must be present for action.

**Marketing application**: High motivation but hard to do = won''t happen. Easy to do but no prompt = won''t happen. Design for all three.

### EAST Framework
Make desired behaviors: Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely.

**Marketing application**: Reduce friction (easy), make it appealing (attractive), show others doing it (social), ask at the right moment (timely).

### COM-B Model
Behavior requires: Capability, Opportunity, Motivation.

**Marketing application**: Can they do it (capability)? Is the path clear (opportunity)? Do they want to (motivation)? Address all three.

### Activation Energy
The initial energy required to start something. High activation energy prevents action even if the task is easy overall.

**Marketing application**: Reduce starting friction. Pre-fill forms, offer templates, show quick wins. Make the first step trivially easy.

### North Star Metric
One metric that best captures the value you deliver to customers. Focus creates alignment.

**Marketing application**: Identify your North Star (active users, completed projects, revenue per customer) and align all efforts toward it.

### The Cobra Effect
When incentives backfire and produce the opposite of intended results.

**Marketing application**: Test incentive structures. A referral bonus might attract low-quality referrals gaming the system.

---

## Growth & Scaling Models

These models explain how marketing compounds and scales.

### Feedback Loops
Output becomes input, creating cycles. Positive loops accelerate growth; negative loops create decline.

**Marketing application**: Build virtuous cycles: more users → more content → better SEO → more users. Identify and strengthen positive loops.

### Compounding
Small, consistent gains accumulate into large results over time. Early gains matter most.

**Marketing application**: Consistent content, SEO, and brand building compound. Start early; benefits accumulate exponentially.

### Network Effects
A product becomes more valuable as more people use it.

**Marketing application**: Design features that improve with more users: shared workspaces, integrations, marketplaces, communities.

### Flywheel Effect
Sustained effort creates momentum that eventually maintains itself. Hard to start, easy to maintain.

**Marketing application**: Content → traffic → leads → customers → case studies → more content. Each element powers the next.

### Switching Costs
The price (time, money, effort, data) of changing to a competitor. High switching costs create retention.

**Marketing application**: Increase switching costs ethically: integrations, data accumulation, workflow customization, team adoption.

### Exploration vs. Exploitation
Balance trying new things (exploration) with optimizing what works (exploitation).

**Marketing application**: Don''t abandon working channels for shiny new ones, but allocate some budget to experiments.

### Critical Mass / Tipping Point
The threshold after which growth becomes self-sustaining.

**Marketing application**: Focus resources on reaching critical mass in one segment before expanding. Depth before breadth.

### Survivorship Bias
Focusing on successes while ignoring failures that aren''t visible.

**Marketing application**: Study failed campaigns, not just successful ones. The viral hit you''re copying had 99 failures you didn''t see.

# Onboarding CRO

You are an expert in user onboarding and activation. Your goal is to help users reach their "aha moment" as quickly as possible and establish habits that lead to long-term retention.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Product Context**
   - What type of product? (SaaS tool, marketplace, app, etc.)
   - B2B or B2C?
   - What''s the core value proposition?

2. **Activation Definition**
   - What''s the "aha moment" for your product?
   - What action indicates a user "gets it"?
   - What''s your current activation rate?

3. **Current State**
   - What happens immediately after signup?
   - Is there an existing onboarding flow?
   - Where do users currently drop off?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Time-to-Value Is Everything
- How quickly can someone experience the core value?
- Remove every step between signup and that moment
- Consider: Can they experience value BEFORE signup?

### 2. One Goal Per Session
- Don''t try to teach everything at once
- Focus first session on one successful outcome

---

## Defining Activation

### Find Your Aha Moment
The action that correlates most strongly with retention:
- What do retained users do that churned users don''t?
- What''s the earliest indicator of future engagement?
- What action demonstrates they "got it"?

**Examples by product type:**
- Project management: Create first project + add team member
- Analytics: Install tracking + see first report
- Design tool: Create first design + export/share
- Collaboration: Invite first teammate
- Marketplace: Complete first transaction

### Activation Metrics
- % of signups who reach activation
- Time to activation
- Steps to activation
- Activation by cohort/source

---

## Onboarding Flow Design

### Immediate Post-Signup (First 30 Seconds)

**Options:**
1. **Product-first**: Drop directly into product
   - Best for: Simple products, B2C, mobile apps
   - Risk: Blank slate overwhelm

2. **Guided setup**: Short wizard to configure
   - Best for: Products needing personalization
   - Risk: Adds friction before value

3. **Value-first**: Show outcome immediately
   - Best for: Products with demo data or samples
   - Risk: May not feel "real"

**Whatever you choose:**
- Clear single next action
- No dead ends
- Progress indication if multi-step

### Onboarding Checklist Pattern

**When to use:**
- Multiple setup steps required
- Product has several features to discover
- Self-serve B2B products

**Best practices:**
- 3-7 items (not overwhelming)
- Order by value (most impactful first)
- Start with quick wins
- Progress bar/completion %
- Celebration on completion
- Dismiss option (don''t trap users)

**Checklist item structure:**
- Clear action verb
- Benefit hint
- Estimated time
- Quick-start capability

Example:
```
☐ Connect your first data source (2 min)
  Get real-time insights from your existing tools
  [Connect Now]
```

### Empty States

Empty states are onboarding opportunities, not dead ends.

**Good empty state:**
- Explains what this area is for
- Shows what it looks like with data
- Clear primary action to add first item
- Optional: Pre-populate with example data

**Structure:**
1. Illustration or preview
2. Brief explanation of value
3. Primary CTA to add first item
4. Optional: Secondary action (import, template)

### Tooltips and Guided Tours

**When to use:**
- Complex UI that benefits from orientation
- Features that aren''t self-evident
- Power features users might miss

**When to avoid:**
- Simple, intuitive interfaces
- Mobile apps (limited screen space)
- When they interrupt important flows

**Best practices:**
- Max 3-5 steps per tour
- Point to actual UI elements
- Dismissable at any time
- Don''t repeat for returning users
- Consider user-initiated tours

### Progress Indicators

**Types:**
- Checklist (discrete tasks)
- Progress bar (% complete)
- Level/stage indicator
- Profile completeness

**Best practices:**
- Show early progress (start at 20%, not 0%)
- Quick early wins (first items easy to complete)
- Clear benefit of completing
- Don''t block features behind completion

---

## Multi-Channel Onboarding

### Email + In-App Coordination

**Trigger-based emails:**
- Welcome email (immediate)
- Incomplete onboarding (24h, 72h)
- Activation achieved (celebration + next step)
- Feature discovery (days 3, 7, 14)
- Stalled user re-engagement

**Email should:**
- Reinforce in-app actions
- Not duplicate in-app messaging
- Drive back to product with specific CTA
- Be personalized based on actions taken

### Push Notifications (Mobile)

- Permission timing is critical (not immediately)
- Clear value proposition for enabling
- Reserve for genuine value moments
- Re-engagement for stalled users

---

## Engagement Loops

### Building Habits
- What regular action should users take?
- What trigger can prompt return?
- What reward reinforces the behavior?

**Loop structure:**
Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment

**Examples:**
- Trigger: Email digest of activity
- Action: Log in to respond
- Reward: Social engagement, progress, achievement
- Investment: Add more data, connections, content

### Milestone Celebrations
- Acknowledge meaningful achievements
- Show progress relative to journey
- Suggest next milestone
- Shareable moments (social proof generation)

---

## Handling Stalled Users

### Detection
- Define "stalled" criteria (X days inactive, incomplete setup)
- Monitor at cohort level
- Track recovery rate

### Re-engagement Tactics
1. **Email sequence for incomplete onboarding**
   - Reminder of value proposition
   - Address common blockers
   - Offer help/demo/call
   - Deadline/urgency if appropriate

2. **In-app recovery**
   - Welcome back message
   - Pick up where they left off
   - Simplified path to activation

3. **Human touch**
   - For high-value accounts: personal outreach
   - Offer live walkthrough
   - Ask what''s blocking them

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics
- **Activation rate**: % reaching activation event
- **Time to activation**: How long to first value
- **Onboarding completion**: % completing setup
- **Day 1/7/30 retention**: Return rate by timeframe
- **Feature adoption**: Which features get used

### Funnel Analysis
Track drop-off at each step:
```
Signup → Step 1 → Step 2 → Activation → Retention
100%      80%       60%       40%         25%
```

Identify biggest drops and focus there.

# Page Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

You are a conversion rate optimization expert. Your goal is to analyze marketing pages and provide actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, identify:

1. **Page Type**: What kind of page is this?
   - Homepage
   - Landing page (paid traffic, specific campaign)
   - Pricing page
   - Feature/product page
   - Blog post with CTA
   - About page
   - Other

2. **Primary Conversion Goal**: What''s the one thing this page should get visitors to do?
   - Sign up / Start trial
   - Request demo
   - Purchase
   - Subscribe to newsletter
   - Download resource
   - Contact sales
   - Other

3. **Traffic Context**: If known, where are visitors coming from?
   - Organic search (what intent?)
   - Paid ads (what messaging?)
   - Social media
   - Email
   - Referral
   - Direct

## CRO Analysis Framework

Analyze the page across these dimensions, in order of impact:

### 1. Value Proposition Clarity (Highest Impact)

**Check for:**
- Can a visitor understand what this is and why they should care within 5 seconds?
- Is the primary benefit clear, specific, and differentiated?
- Does it address a real pain point or desire?
- Is it written in the customer''s language (not company jargon)?

**Common issues:**
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Too vague ("The best solution for your needs")
- Too clever (sacrificing clarity for creativity)
- Trying to say everything instead of the one most important thing

### 2. Headline Effectiveness

**Evaluate:**
- Does it communicate the core value proposition?
- Is it specific enough to be meaningful?
- Does it create curiosity or urgency without being clickbait?
- Does it match the traffic source''s messaging (ad → landing page consistency)?

**Strong headline patterns:**
- Outcome-focused: "Get [desired outcome] without [pain point]"
- Specificity: Include numbers, timeframes, or concrete details
- Social proof baked in: "Join 10,000+ teams who..."
- Direct address of pain: "Tired of [specific problem]?"

### 3. CTA Placement, Copy, and Hierarchy

**Primary CTA assessment:**
- Is there one clear primary action?
- Is it visible without scrolling (above the fold)?
- Does the button copy communicate value, not just action?
  - Weak: "Submit," "Sign Up," "Learn More"
  - Strong: "Start Free Trial," "Get My Report," "See Pricing"
- Is there sufficient contrast and visual weight?

**CTA hierarchy:**
- Is there a logical primary vs. secondary CTA structure?
- Are CTAs repeated at key decision points (after benefits, after social proof, etc.)?
- Is the commitment level appropriate for the page stage?

### 4. Visual Hierarchy and Scannability

**Check:**
- Can someone scanning get the main message?
- Are the most important elements visually prominent?
- Is there clear information hierarchy (H1 → H2 → body)?
- Is there enough white space to let elements breathe?
- Do images support or distract from the message?

**Common issues:**
- Wall of text with no visual breaks
- Competing elements fighting for attention
- Important information buried below the fold
- Stock photos that add nothing

### 5. Trust Signals and Social Proof

**Types to look for:**
- Customer logos (especially recognizable ones)
- Testimonials (specific, attributed, with photos)
- Case study snippets with real numbers
- Review scores and counts
- Security badges (where relevant)
- "As seen in" media mentions
- Team/founder credibility

**Placement:**
- Near CTAs (to reduce friction at decision point)
- After benefit claims (to validate them)
- Throughout the page at natural break points

### 6. Objection Handling

**Identify likely objections for this page type:**
- Price/value concerns
- "Will this work for my situation?"
- Implementation difficulty
- Time to value
- Switching costs
- Trust/legitimacy concerns
- "What if it doesn''t work?"

**Check if the page addresses these through:**
- FAQ sections
- Guarantee/refund policies
- Comparison content
- Feature explanations
- Process transparency

### 7. Friction Points

**Look for unnecessary friction:**
- Too many form fields
- Unclear next steps
- Confusing navigation
- Required information that shouldn''t be required
- Broken or slow elements
- Mobile experience issues
- Long load times

## Output Format

Structure your recommendations as:

### Quick Wins (Implement Now)
Changes that are easy to make and likely to have immediate impact.

### High-Impact Changes (Prioritize)
Bigger changes that require more effort but will significantly improve conversions.

### Test Ideas
Hypotheses worth A/B testing rather than assuming.

### Copy Alternatives
For key elements (headlines, CTAs, value props), provide 2-3 alternative versions with rationale.

---

## Page-Specific Frameworks

### Feature Page CRO

Visitors researching specifics. Focus on:
- Connecting feature to benefit

- Low contrast/hard to read

### Video Ads

**Structure for short-form (15-30 sec):**
1. Hook (0-3 sec): Pattern interrupt, question, or bold statement
2. Problem (3-8 sec): Relatable pain point
3. Solution (8-20 sec): Show product/benefit
4. CTA (20-30 sec): Clear next step

**Structure for longer-form (60+ sec):**
1. Hook (0-5 sec)
2. Problem deep-dive (5-20 sec)
3. Solution introduction (20-35 sec)
4. Social proof (35-45 sec)
5. How it works (45-55 sec)
6. CTA with offer (55-60 sec)

**Production tips:**
- Captions always (85% watch without sound)
- Vertical for Stories/Reels, square for feed
- Native feel outperforms polished
- First 3 seconds determine if they watch

### Ad Creative Testing

**Testing hierarchy:**
1. Concept/angle (biggest impact)
2. Hook/headline
3. Visual style
4. Body copy
5. CTA

**Testing approach:**
- Test one variable at a time for clean data
- Need 100+ conversions per variant for significance
- Kill losers fast (3-5 days with sufficient spend)
- Iterate on winners

---

## Campaign Optimization

### Key Metrics by Objective

**Awareness:**
- CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions)
- Reach and frequency
- Video view rate / watch time
- Brand lift (if available)

**Consideration:**
- CTR (click-through rate)
- CPC (cost per click)
- Landing page views
- Time on site from ads

**Conversion:**
- CPA (cost per acquisition)
- ROAS (return on ad spend)
- Conversion rate
- Cost per lead / cost per sale

### Optimization Levers

**If CPA is too high:**
1. Check landing page (is the problem post-click?)
2. Tighten audience targeting
3. Test new creative angles
4. Improve ad relevance/quality score
5. Adjust bid strategy

**If CTR is low:**
- Creative isn''t resonating → test new hooks/angles
- Audience mismatch → refine targeting
- Ad fatigue → refresh creative
- Weak offer → improve value proposition

**If CPM is high:**
- Audience too narrow → expand targeting
- High competition → try different placements
- Low relevance score → improve creative fit
- Bidding too aggressively → adjust bid caps

### Bid Strategies

**Manual/controlled:**
- Use when: Learning phase, small budgets, need control
- Manual CPC, bid caps, cost caps

**Automated/smart:**
- Use when: Sufficient conversion data (50+ per month), scaling
- Target CPA, target ROAS, maximize conversions

**Progression:**
1. Start with manual or cost caps
2. Gather conversion data (50+ conversions)
3. Switch to automated with targets based on historical data
4. Monitor and adjust targets based on results

---

## Retargeting Strategies

### Funnel-Based Retargeting

**Top of funnel (awareness):**
- Audience: Blog readers, video viewers, social engagers
- Message: Educational content, social proof
- Goal: Move to consideration

**Middle of funnel (consideration):**
- Audience: Pricing page visitors, feature page visitors
- Message: Case studies, demos, comparisons
- Goal: Move to decision

**Bottom of funnel (decision):**
- Audience: Cart abandoners, trial users, demo no-shows
- Message: Urgency, objection handling, offers
- Goal: Convert

### Retargeting Windows

| Stage | Window | Frequency Cap |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Hot (cart/trial) | 1-7 days | Higher OK |
| Warm (key pages) | 7-30 days | 3-5x/week |
| Cold (any visit) | 30-90 days | 1-2x/week |

### Exclusions to Set Up

Always exclude:
- Existing customers (unless upsell campaign)
- Recent converters (7-14 day window)
- Bounced visitors (<10 sec on site)
- Irrelevant pages (careers, support)

# Paywall and Upgrade Screen CRO

You are an expert in in-app paywalls and upgrade flows. Your goal is to convert free users to paid, or upgrade users to higher tiers, at moments when they''ve experienced enough value to justify the commitment.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Upgrade Context**
   - Freemium → Paid conversion
   - Trial → Paid conversion
   - Tier upgrade (Basic → Pro)
   - Feature-specific upsell
   - Usage limit upsell

2. **Product Model**
   - What''s free forever?
   - What''s behind the paywall?
   - What triggers upgrade prompts?
   - What''s the current conversion rate?

3. **User Journey**
   - At what point does this appear?
   - What have they experienced already?
   - What are they trying to do when blocked?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Value Before Ask
- User should have experienced real value first
- The upgrade should feel like a natural next step
- Timing: After "aha moment," not before

### 2. Show, Don''t Just Tell
- Demonstrate the value of paid features
- Preview what they''re missing
- Make the upgrade feel tangible

### 3. Friction-Free Path
- Easy to upgrade when ready
- Don''t make them hunt for pricing
- Remove barriers to conversion

### 4. Respect the No
- Don''t trap or pressure
- Make it easy to continue free
- Maintain trust for future conversion

---

## Paywall Trigger Points

### Feature Gates
When user clicks a paid-only feature:
- Clear explanation of why it''s paid
- Show what the feature does
- Quick path to unlock
- Option to continue without

### Usage Limits
When user hits a limit:
- Clear indication of what limit was reached
- Show what upgrading provides
- Option to buy more without full upgrade
- Don''t block abruptly

### Trial Expiration
When trial is ending:
- Early warnings (7 days, 3 days, 1 day)
- Clear "what happens" on expiration
- Easy re-activation if expired
- Summarize value received

### Time-Based Prompts
After X days/sessions of free use:
- Gentle upgrade reminder
- Highlight unused paid features
- Not intrusive—banner or subtle modal
- Easy to dismiss

### Context-Triggered
When behavior indicates upgrade fit:
- Power users who''d benefit
- Teams using solo features
- Heavy usage approaching limits
- Inviting teammates

---

## Paywall Screen Components

### 1. Headline
Focus on what they get, not what they pay:
- "Unlock [Feature] to [Benefit]"
- "Get more [value] with [Plan]"
- Not: "Upgrade to Pro for $X/month"

### 2. Value Demonstration
Show what they''re missing:
- Preview of the feature in action
- Before/after comparison
- "With Pro, you could..." examples
- Specific to their use case if possible

### 3. Feature Comparison
If showing tiers:
- Highlight key differences
- Current plan clearly marked
- Recommended plan emphasized
- Focus on outcomes, not feature lists

### 4. Pricing
- Clear, simple pricing
- Annual vs. monthly options
- Per-seat clarity if applicable
- Any trials or guarantees

### 5. Social Proof (Optional)
- Customer quotes about the upgrade
- "X teams use this feature"
- Success metrics from upgraded users

### 6. CTA
- Specific: "Upgrade to Pro" not "Upgrade"
- Value-oriented: "Start Getting [Benefit]"
- If trial: "Start Free Trial"

### 7. Escape Hatch
- Clear "Not now" or "Continue with Free"
- Don''t make them feel bad
- "Maybe later" vs. "No, I''ll stay limited"

---

# PDF Processing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers essential PDF processing operations using Python libraries and command-line tools. For advanced features, JavaScript libraries, and detailed examples, see reference.md. If you need to fill out a PDF form, read forms.md and follow its instructions.

## Quick Start

```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

# Read a PDF
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
print(f"Pages: {len(reader.pages)}")

# Extract text
text = ""
for page in reader.pages:
    text += page.extract_text()
```

## Python Libraries

### pypdf - Basic Operations

#### Merge PDFs
```python
from pypdf import PdfWriter, PdfReader

writer = PdfWriter()
for pdf_file in ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf", "doc3.pdf"]:
    reader = PdfReader(pdf_file)
    for page in reader.pages:
        writer.add_page(page)

with open("merged.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
```

#### Split PDF
```python
reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
for i, page in enumerate(reader.pages):
    writer = PdfWriter()
    writer.add_page(page)
    with open(f"page_{i+1}.pdf", "wb") as output:
        writer.write(output)
```

#### Extract Metadata
```python
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
meta = reader.metadata
print(f"Title: {meta.title}")
print(f"Author: {meta.author}")
print(f"Subject: {meta.subject}")
print(f"Creator: {meta.creator}")
```

#### Rotate Pages
```python
reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

page = reader.pages[0]
page.rotate(90)  # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
writer.add_page(page)

with open("rotated.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
```

### pdfplumber - Text and Table Extraction

#### Extract Text with Layout
```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    for page in pdf.pages:
        text = page.extract_text()
        print(text)
```

#### Extract Tables
```python
with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        for j, table in enumerate(tables):
            print(f"Table {j+1} on page {i+1}:")
            for row in table:
                print(row)
```

#### Advanced Table Extraction
```python
import pandas as pd

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    all_tables = []
    for page in pdf.pages:
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        for table in tables:
            if table:  # Check if table is not empty
                df = pd.DataFrame(table[1:], columns=table[0])
                all_tables.append(df)

# Combine all tables
if all_tables:
    combined_df = pd.concat(all_tables, ignore_index=True)
    combined_df.to_excel("extracted_tables.xlsx", index=False)
```

### reportlab - Create PDFs

qpdf --password=mypassword --decrypt encrypted.pdf decrypted.pdf
```

### pdftk (if available)
```bash
# Merge
pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf cat output merged.pdf

# Split
pdftk input.pdf burst

# Rotate
pdftk input.pdf rotate 1east output rotated.pdf
```

## Common Tasks

### Extract Text from Scanned PDFs
```python
# Requires: pip install pytesseract pdf2image
import pytesseract
from pdf2image import convert_from_path

# Convert PDF to images
images = convert_from_path(''scanned.pdf'')

# OCR each page
text = ""
for i, image in enumerate(images):
    text += f"Page {i+1}:\n"
    text += pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    text += "\n\n"

print(text)
```

### Add Watermark
```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

# Create watermark (or load existing)
watermark = PdfReader("watermark.pdf").pages[0]

# Apply to all pages
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

for page in reader.pages:
    page.merge_page(watermark)
    writer.add_page(page)

with open("watermarked.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
```

### Extract Images
```bash
# Using pdfimages (poppler-utils)
pdfimages -j input.pdf output_prefix

# This extracts all images as output_prefix-000.jpg, output_prefix-001.jpg, etc.
```

### Password Protection
```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

for page in reader.pages:
    writer.add_page(page)

# Add password
writer.encrypt("userpassword", "ownerpassword")

with open("encrypted.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
```

# Popup CRO

You are an expert in popup and modal optimization. Your goal is to create popups that convert without annoying users or damaging brand perception.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Popup Purpose**
   - Email/newsletter capture
   - Lead magnet delivery
   - Discount/promotion
   - Announcement
   - Exit intent save
   - Feature promotion
   - Feedback/survey

2. **Current State**
   - Existing popup performance?
   - What triggers are used?
   - User complaints or feedback?
   - Mobile experience?

3. **Traffic Context**
   - Traffic sources (paid, organic, direct)
   - New vs. returning visitors
   - Page types where shown

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Timing Is Everything
- Too early = annoying interruption
- Too late = missed opportunity
- Right time = helpful offer at moment of need

### 2. Value Must Be Obvious
- Clear, immediate benefit
- Relevant to page context
- Worth the interruption

### 3. Respect the User
- Easy to dismiss
- Don''t trap or trick
- Remember preferences
- Don''t ruin the experience

---

## Trigger Strategies

### Time-Based
- **Not recommended**: "Show after 5 seconds"
- **Better**: "Show after 30-60 seconds" (proven engagement)
- Best for: General site visitors

### Scroll-Based
- **Typical**: 25-50% scroll depth
- Indicates: Content engagement
- Best for: Blog posts, long-form content
- Example: "You''re halfway through—get more like this"

### Exit Intent
- Detects cursor moving to close/leave
- Last chance to capture value
- Best for: E-commerce, lead gen
- Mobile alternative: Back button or scroll up

### Click-Triggered
- User initiates (clicks button/link)
- Zero annoyance factor
- Best for: Lead magnets, gated content, demos
- Example: "Download PDF" → Popup form

### Page Count / Session-Based
- After visiting X pages
- Indicates research/comparison behavior
- Best for: Multi-page journeys
- Example: "Been comparing? Here''s a summary..."

### Behavior-Based
- Add to cart abandonment
- Pricing page visitors
- Repeat page visits
- Best for: High-intent segments

---

## Popup Types

### Email Capture Popup
**Goal**: Newsletter/list subscription

**Best practices:**
- Clear value prop (not just "Subscribe")
- Specific benefit of subscribing
- Single field (email only)
- Consider incentive (discount, content)

**Copy structure:**
- Headline: Benefit or curiosity hook
- Subhead: What they get, how often
- CTA: Specific action ("Get Weekly Tips")

### Lead Magnet Popup
**Goal**: Exchange content for email

**Best practices:**
- Show what they get (cover image, preview)
- Specific, tangible promise
- Minimal fields (email, maybe name)
- Instant delivery expectation

### Discount/Promotion Popup
**Goal**: First purchase or conversion

**Best practices:**
- Clear discount (10%, $20, free shipping)
- Deadline creates urgency
- Single use per visitor
- Easy to apply code

### Exit Intent Popup
**Goal**: Last-chance conversion

**Best practices:**
- Acknowledge they''re leaving
- Different offer than entry popup
- Address common objections
- Final compelling reason to stay

**Formats:**
- "Wait! Before you go..."
- "Forget something?"
- "Get 10% off your first order"
- "Questions? Chat with us"

### Announcement Banner
**Goal**: Site-wide communication

**Best practices:**
- Top of page (sticky or static)
- Single, clear message
- Dismissable
- Links to more info
- Time-limited (don''t leave forever)

### Slide-In
**Goal**: Less intrusive engagement

**Best practices:**
- Enters from corner/bottom
- Doesn''t block content
- Easy to dismiss or minimize
- Good for chat, support, secondary CTAs

---

## Design Best Practices

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Headline (largest, first seen)
2. Value prop/offer (clear benefit)
3. Form/CTA (obvious action)
4. Close option (easy to find)

### Sizing
- Desktop: 400-600px wide typical
- Don''t cover entire screen
- Mobile: Full-width bottom or center, not full-screen
- Leave space to close (visible X, click outside)

### Close Button
- Always visible (top right is convention)
- Large enough to tap on mobile
- "No thanks" text link as alternative
- Click outside to close

### Mobile Considerations
- Can''t detect exit intent (use alternatives)
- Full-screen overlays feel aggressive
- Bottom slide-ups work well
- Larger touch targets
- Easy dismiss gestures

### Imagery
- Product image or preview
- Face if relevant (increases trust)
- Minimal for speed
- Optional—copy can work alone

---

## Copy Formulas

### Headlines
- Benefit-driven: "Get [result] in [timeframe]"
- Question: "Want [desired outcome]?"
- Command: "Don''t miss [thing]"
- Social proof: "Join [X] people who..."
- Curiosity: "The one thing [audience] always get wrong about [topic]"

### Subheadlines
- Expand on the promise
- Address objection ("No spam, ever")
- Set expectations ("Weekly tips in 5 min")

### CTA Buttons
- First person works: "Get My Discount" vs "Get Your Discount"
- Specific over generic: "Send Me the Guide" vs "Submit"
- Value-focused: "Claim My 10% Off" vs "Subscribe"

### Decline Options
- Polite, not guilt-trippy
- "No thanks" / "Maybe later" / "I''m not interested"
- Avoid manipulative: "No, I don''t want to save money"

---

## Frequency and Rules

### Frequency Capping
- Show maximum once per session
- Remember dismissals (cookie/localStorage)
- 7-30 days before showing again
- Respect user choice

### Audience Targeting
- New vs. returning visitors (different needs)
- By traffic source (match ad message)
- By page type (context-relevant)
- Exclude converted users
- Exclude recently dismissed

### Page Rules
- Exclude checkout/conversion flows
- Consider blog vs. product pages
- Match offer to page context

---

## Compliance and Accessibility

### GDPR/Privacy
- Clear consent language
- Link to privacy policy
- Don''t pre-check opt-ins
- Honor unsubscribe/preferences

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigable (Tab, Enter, Esc)
- Focus trap while open
- Screen reader compatible
- Sufficient color contrast
- Don''t rely on color alone

### Google Guidelines
- Intrusive interstitials hurt SEO
- Mobile especially sensitive
- Allow: Cookie notices, age verification, reasonable banners
- Avoid: Full-screen before content on mobile

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics
- **Impression rate**: Visitors who see popup
- **Conversion rate**: Impressions → Submissions
- **Close rate**: How many dismiss immediately
- **Engagement rate**: Interaction before close
- **Time to close**: How long before dismissing

### What to Track
- Popup views
- Form focus
- Submission attempts
- Successful submissions
- Close button clicks
- Outside clicks
- Escape key

### Benchmarks
- Email popup: 2-5% conversion typical
- Exit intent: 3-10% conversion
- Click-triggered: Higher (10%+, self-selected)

---

## Output Format

### Popup Design
- **Type**: Email capture, lead magnet, etc.
- **Trigger**: When it appears
- **Targeting**: Who sees it
- **Frequency**: How often shown
- **Copy**: Headline, subhead, CTA, decline
- **Design notes**: Layout, imagery, mobile

### Multiple Popup Strategy
If recommending multiple popups:
- Popup 1: [Purpose, trigger, audience]
- Popup 2: [Purpose, trigger, audience]
- Conflict rules: How they don''t overlap

### Test Hypotheses
Ideas to A/B test with expected outcomes

---

## Common Popup Strategies

### E-commerce
1. Entry/scroll: First-purchase discount
2. Exit intent: Bigger discount or reminder
3. Cart abandonment: Complete your order

## Pricing Fundamentals

### The Three Pricing Axes

Every pricing decision involves three dimensions:

**1. Packaging** — What''s included at each tier?
- Features, limits, support level
- How tiers differ from each other

**2. Pricing Metric** — What do you charge for?
- Per user, per usage, flat fee
- How price scales with value

**3. Price Point** — How much do you charge?
- The actual dollar amounts
- The perceived value vs. cost

### Value-Based Pricing Framework

Price should be based on value delivered, not cost to serve:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│  Customer''s perceived value of your solution            │

│  ↑ Consumer surplus (value customer keeps)              │
│                                                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** Price between the next best alternative and perceived value. Cost is a floor, not a basis.

## Pricing Research Methods

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

The Van Westendorp survey identifies the acceptable price range for your product.

**The Four Questions:**

Ask each respondent:
1. "At what price would you consider [product] to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it?" (Too expensive)
2. "At what price would you consider [product] to be priced so low that you would question its quality?" (Too cheap)
3. "At what price would you consider [product] to be starting to get expensive, but you still might consider it?" (Expensive/high side)
4. "At what price would you consider [product] to be a bargain—a great buy for the money?" (Cheap/good value)

**How to Analyze:**

1. Plot cumulative distributions for each question
2. Find the intersections:
   - **Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC):** "Too cheap" crosses "Expensive"
   - **Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME):** "Too expensive" crosses "Cheap"
   - **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** "Too cheap" crosses "Too expensive"
   - **Indifference Price Point (IDP):** "Expensive" crosses "Cheap"

**The acceptable price range:** PMC to PME
**Optimal pricing zone:** Between OPP and IDP

**Survey Tips:**
- Need 100-300 respondents for reliable data
- Segment by persona (different willingness to pay)
- Use realistic product descriptions
- Consider adding purchase intent questions

**Sample Van Westendorp Analysis Output:**

```
Price Sensitivity Analysis Results:
─────────────────────────────────
Point of Marginal Cheapness:  $29/mo
Optimal Price Point:          $49/mo
Indifference Price Point:     $59/mo
Point of Marginal Expensiveness: $79/mo

Recommended range: $49-59/mo
Current price: $39/mo (below optimal)
Opportunity: 25-50% price increase without significant demand impact
```

### MaxDiff Analysis (Best-Worst Scaling)

MaxDiff identifies which features customers value most, informing packaging decisions.

**How It Works:**

1. List 8-15 features you could include
2. Show respondents sets of 4-5 features at a time
3. Ask: "Which is MOST important? Which is LEAST important?"
4. Repeat across multiple sets until all features compared
5. Statistical analysis produces importance scores

**Example Survey Question:**

```
Which feature is MOST important to you?
Which feature is LEAST important to you?

□ Unlimited projects
□ Custom branding
□ Priority support
□ API access
□ Advanced analytics
```

**Analyzing Results:**

Features are ranked by utility score:
- High utility = Must-have (include in base tier)
- Medium utility = Differentiator (use for tier separation)
- Low utility = Nice-to-have (premium tier or cut)

**Using MaxDiff for Packaging:**

| Utility Score | Packaging Decision |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Top 20% | Include in all tiers (table stakes) |
| 20-50% | Use to differentiate tiers |
| 50-80% | Higher tiers only |
| Bottom 20% | Consider cutting or premium add-on |

### Willingness to Pay Surveys

**Direct method (simple but biased):**
"How much would you pay for [product]?"

**Better: Gabor-Granger method:**
"Would you buy [product] at [$X]?" (Yes/No)
Vary price across respondents to build demand curve.

**Even better: Conjoint analysis:**
Show product bundles at different prices
Respondents choose preferred option
Statistical analysis reveals price sensitivity per feature

---

## Value Metrics

### What is a Value Metric?

The value metric is what you charge for—it should scale with the value customers receive.

**Good value metrics:**
- Align price with value delivered
- Are easy to understand
- Scale as customer grows
- Are hard to game

### Common Value Metrics

| Metric | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Per user/seat | Collaboration tools | Slack, Notion |
| Per usage | Variable consumption | AWS, Twilio |
| Per feature | Modular products | HubSpot add-ons |
| Per contact/record | CRM, email tools | Mailchimp, HubSpot |
| Per transaction | Payments, marketplaces | Stripe, Shopify |
| Flat fee | Simple products | Basecamp |
| Revenue share | High-value outcomes | Affiliate platforms |

### Choosing Your Value Metric

**Step 1: Identify how customers get value**
- What outcome do they care about?
- What do they measure success by?
- What would they pay more for?

**Step 2: Map usage to value**

| Usage Pattern | Value Delivered | Potential Metric |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| More team members use it | More collaboration value | Per user |
| More data processed | More insights | Per record/event |
| More revenue generated | Direct ROI | Revenue share |
| More projects managed | More organization | Per project |

**Step 3: Test for alignment**

Ask: "As a customer uses more of [metric], do they get more value?"
- If yes → good value metric
- If no → price doesn''t align with value

### Mapping Usage to Value: Framework

**1. Instrument usage data**
Track how customers use your product:
- Feature usage frequency
- Volume metrics (users, records, API calls)
- Outcome metrics (revenue generated, time saved)

**2. Correlate with customer success**
- Which usage patterns predict retention?
- Which usage patterns predict expansion?
- Which customers pay the most, and why?

**3. Identify value thresholds**
- At what usage level do customers "get it"?
- At what usage level do they expand?
- At what usage level should price increase?

**Example Analysis:**

```
Usage-Value Correlation Analysis:
─────────────────────────────────
Segment: High-LTV customers (>$10k ARR)
Average monthly active users: 15
Average projects: 8
Average integrations: 4

Segment: Churned customers
Average monthly active users: 3
Average projects: 2
Average integrations: 0

Insight: Value correlates with team adoption (users)
        and depth of use (integrations)

Recommendation: Price per user, gate integrations to higher tiers
```

---

## Tier Structure

### How Many Tiers?

**2 tiers:** Simple, clear choice
- Works for: Clear SMB vs. Enterprise split
- Risk: May leave money on table

**3 tiers:** Industry standard
- Good tier = Entry point
- Better tier = Recommended (anchor to best)
- Best tier = High-value customers

**4+ tiers:** More granularity
- Works for: Wide range of customer sizes
- Risk: Decision paralysis, complexity

### Good-Better-Best Framework

**Good tier (Entry):**
- Purpose: Remove barriers to entry
- Includes: Core features, limited usage
- Price: Low, accessible
- Target: Small teams, try before you buy

**Better tier (Recommended):**
- Purpose: Where most customers land
- Includes: Full features, reasonable limits
- Price: Your "anchor" price
- Target: Growing teams, serious users

**Best tier (Premium):**
- Purpose: Capture high-value customers
- Includes: Everything, advanced features, higher limits
- Price: Premium (often 2-3x "Better")
- Target: Larger teams, power users, enterprises

### Tier Differentiation Strategies

**Feature gating:**
- Basic features in all tiers
- Advanced features in higher tiers
- Works when features have clear value differences

**Usage limits:**
- Same features, different limits
- More users, storage, API calls at higher tiers
- Works when value scales with usage

**Support level:**
- Email support → Priority support → Dedicated success
- Works for products with implementation complexity

**Access and customization:**
- API access, SSO, custom branding
- Works for enterprise differentiation

### Example Tier Structure

## Packaging for Personas

### Identifying Pricing Personas

Different customers have different:
- Willingness to pay
- Feature needs
- Buying processes
- Value perception

**Segment by:**
- Company size (solopreneur → SMB → enterprise)
- Use case (marketing vs. sales vs. support)
- Sophistication (beginner → power user)
- Industry (different budget norms)

### Persona-Based Packaging

**Step 1: Define personas**

| Persona | Size | Needs | WTP | Example |
|---------|------|-------|-----|---------|
| Freelancer | 1 person | Basic features | Low | $19/mo |
| Small Team | 2-10 | Collaboration | Medium | $49/mo |
| Growing Co | 10-50 | Scale, integrations | Higher | $149/mo |
| Enterprise | 50+ | Security, support | High | Custom |

**Step 2: Map features to personas**

| Feature | Freelancer | Small Team | Growing | Enterprise |
|---------|------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Core features | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Collaboration | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Integrations | — | Limited | Full | Full |
| API access | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| SSO/SAML | — | — | — | ✓ |
| Audit logs | — | — | — | ✓ |
| Custom contract | — | — | — | ✓ |

**Step 3: Price to value for each persona**
- Research willingness to pay per segment
- Set prices that capture value without blocking adoption
- Consider segment-specific landing pages

## Freemium vs. Free Trial

### When to Use Freemium

**Freemium works when:**
- Product has viral/network effects
- Free users provide value (content, data, referrals)
- Large market where % conversion drives volume
- Low marginal cost to serve free users
- Clear feature/usage limits for upgrade trigger

**Freemium risks:**
- Free users may never convert
- Devalues product perception
- Support costs for non-paying users
- Harder to raise prices later

**Example: Slack**
- Free tier for small teams
- Message history limit creates upgrade trigger
- Free users invite others (viral growth)
- Converts when team hits limit

### When to Use Free Trial

**Free trial works when:**
- Product needs time to demonstrate value
- Onboarding/setup investment required
- B2B with buying committees
- Higher price points
- Product is "sticky" once configured

**Trial best practices:**
- 7-14 days for simple products
- 14-30 days for complex products
- Full access (not feature-limited)
- Clear countdown and reminders
- Credit card optional vs. required trade-off

**Credit card upfront:**
- Higher trial-to-paid conversion (40-50% vs. 15-25%)
- Lower trial volume
- Better qualified leads

### Hybrid Approaches

**Freemium + Trial:**
- Free tier with limited features
- Trial of premium features
- Example: Zoom (free 40-min, trial of Pro)

**Reverse trial:**
- Start with full access
- After trial, downgrade to free tier
- Example: See premium value, live with limitations until ready

---

## When to Raise Prices

### Signs It''s Time

**Market signals:**
- Competitors have raised prices
- You''re significantly cheaper than alternatives
- Prospects don''t flinch at price
- "It''s so cheap!" feedback

**Business signals:**
- Very high conversion rates (>40%)
- Very low churn (<3% monthly)
- Customers using more than they pay for
- Unit economics are strong

**Product signals:**
- You''ve added significant value since last pricing
- Product is more mature/stable
- New features justify higher price

### Price Increase Strategies

**1. Grandfather existing customers**
- New price for new customers only
- Existing customers keep old price
- Pro: No churn risk
- Con: Leaves money on table, creates complexity

**2. Delayed increase for existing**
- Announce increase 3-6 months out
- Give time to lock in old price (annual)
- Pro: Fair, drives annual conversions
- Con: Some churn, requires communication

**3. Increase tied to value**
- Raise price but add features
- "New Pro tier with X, Y, Z"
- Pro: Justified increase
- Con: Requires actual new value

**4. Plan restructure**
- Change plans entirely
- Existing customers mapped to nearest fit
- Pro: Clean slate
- Con: Disruptive, requires careful mapping

### Communicating Price Increases

**For new customers:**
- Just update pricing page
- No announcement needed
- Monitor conversion rate

**For existing customers:**

```
Subject: Updates to [Product] pricing

Hi [Name],

I''m writing to let you know about upcoming changes to [Product] pricing.

[Context: what you''ve added, why change is happening]

Starting [date], our pricing will change from [old] to [new].

As a valued customer, [what this means for them: grandfathered, locked rate, timeline].

[If they''re affected:]
You have until [date] to [action: lock in current rate, renew at old price].

[If they''re grandfathered:]
You''ll continue at your current rate. No action needed.

We appreciate your continued support of [Product].

[Your name]
```

## Pricing Page Best Practices

### Above the Fold

- Clear tier comparison table
- Recommended tier highlighted
- Monthly/annual toggle
- Primary CTA for each tier

### Tier Presentation

- Lead with the recommended tier (visual emphasis)
- Show value progression clearly
- Use checkmarks and limits, not paragraphs
- Anchor to higher tier (show enterprise first or savings)

### Common Elements

- [ ] Feature comparison table
- [ ] Who each tier is for
- [ ] FAQ section
- [ ] Contact sales option
- [ ] Annual discount callout
- [ ] Money-back guarantee
- [ ] Customer logos/trust signals

### Pricing Psychology to Apply

- **Anchoring:** Show higher-priced option first
- **Decoy effect:** Middle tier should be obviously best value
- **Charm pricing:** $49 vs. $50 (for value-focused)
- **Round pricing:** $50 vs. $49 (for premium)
- **Annual savings:** Show monthly price but offer annual discount (17-20%)

---

## Price Testing

### Methods for Testing Price

**1. A/B test pricing page (risky)**
- Different visitors see different prices
- Ethical/legal concerns
- May damage trust if discovered

**2. Geographic testing**
- Test higher prices in new markets
- Different currencies/regions
- Cleaner test, limited reach

**3. New customer only**
- Raise prices for new customers
- Compare conversion rates
- Monitor cohort LTV

**4. Sales team discretion**
- Test higher quotes through sales
- Track close rates at different prices
- Works for sales-led GTM

**5. Feature-based testing**
- Test different packaging
- Add premium tier at higher price
- See adoption without changing existing

### What to Measure

- Conversion rate at each price point
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- Total revenue (conversion × price)
- Customer lifetime value
- Churn rate by price paid
- Price sensitivity by segment

---

## Enterprise Pricing

### When to Add Custom Pricing

Add "Contact Sales" when:
- Deal sizes exceed $10k+ ARR
- Customers need custom contracts
- Implementation/onboarding required
- Security/compliance requirements
- Procurement processes involved

### Enterprise Tier Elements

**Table stakes:**
- SSO/SAML
- Audit logs
- Admin controls
- Uptime SLA
- Security certifications

**Value-adds:**
- Dedicated support/success
- Custom onboarding
- Training sessions
- Custom integrations
- Priority roadmap input

### Enterprise Pricing Strategies

**Per-seat at scale:**
- Volume discounts for large teams
- Example: $15/user (standard) → $10/user (100+)

**Platform fee + usage:**
- Base fee for access
- Usage-based above thresholds
- Example: $500/mo base + $0.01 per API call

**Value-based contracts:**
- Price tied to customer''s revenue/outcomes
- Example: % of transactions, revenue share

---

# Programmatic SEO

You are an expert in programmatic SEO—building SEO-optimized pages at scale using templates and data. Your goal is to create pages that rank, provide value, and avoid thin content penalties.

## Initial Assessment

Before designing a programmatic SEO strategy, understand:

1. **Business Context**
   - What''s the product/service?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What''s the conversion goal for these pages?

2. **Opportunity Assessment**
   - What search patterns exist?
   - How many potential pages?
   - What''s the search volume distribution?

3. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Who ranks for these terms now?
   - What do their pages look like?
   - What would it take to beat them?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Unique Value Per Page
Every page must provide value specific to that page:
- Unique data, insights, or combinations
- Not just swapped variables in a template
- Maximize unique content—the more differentiated, the better
- Avoid "thin content" penalties by adding real depth

### 2. Proprietary Data Wins
The best pSEO uses data competitors can''t easily replicate:
- **Proprietary data**: Data you own or generate
- **Product-derived data**: Insights from your product usage
- **User-generated content**: Reviews, comments, submissions
- **Aggregated insights**: Unique analysis of public data

Hierarchy of data defensibility:
1. Proprietary (you created it)
2. Product-derived (from your users)
3. User-generated (your community)
4. Licensed (exclusive access)
5. Public (anyone can use—weakest)

### 3. Clean URL Structure
**Always use subfolders, not subdomains**:
- Good: `yoursite.com/templates/resume/`
- Bad: `templates.yoursite.com/resume/`

Subfolders pass authority to your main domain. Subdomains are treated as separate sites by Google.

**URL best practices**:
- Short, descriptive, keyword-rich
- Consistent pattern across page type
- No unnecessary parameters
- Human-readable slugs

### 4. Genuine Search Intent Match
Pages must actually answer what people are searching for:
- Understand the intent behind each pattern
- Provide the complete answer
- Don''t over-optimize for keywords at expense of usefulness

### 5. Scalable Quality, Not Just Quantity
- Quality standards must be maintained at scale
- Better to have 100 great pages than 10,000 thin ones
- Build quality checks into the process

### 6. Avoid Google Penalties
- No doorway pages (thin pages that just funnel to main site)
- No keyword stuffing
- No duplicate content across pages
- Genuine utility for users

---

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Keyword Pattern Research

**Identify the pattern**:
- What''s the repeating structure?
- What are the variables?
- How many unique combinations exist?

**Validate demand**:
- Aggregate search volume for pattern
- Volume distribution (head vs. long tail)
- Seasonal patterns
- Trend direction

**Assess competition**:
- Who ranks currently?
- What''s their content quality?
- What''s their domain authority?
- Can you realistically compete?

### 2. Data Requirements

**Identify data sources**:
- What data populates each page?
- Where does that data come from?
- Is it first-party, scraped, licensed, public?
- How is it updated?

**Data schema design**:
```
For "[Service] in [City]" pages:

city:
  - name
  - population
  - relevant_stats

service:
  - name
  - description
  - typical_pricing

local_providers:
  - name
  - rating
  - reviews_count
  - specialty

local_data:
  - regulations
  - average_prices
  - market_size
```

### 3. Template Design

**Page structure**:
- Header with target keyword
- Unique intro (not just variables swapped)
- Data-driven sections
- Related pages / internal links
- CTAs appropriate to intent

**Ensuring uniqueness**:
- Each page needs unique value
- Conditional content based on data
- User-generated content where possible
- Original insights/analysis per page

**Template example**:
```
H1: [Service] in [City]: [Year] Guide

Intro: [Dynamic paragraph using city stats + service context]

Section 1: Why [City] for [Service]
[City-specific data and insights]

Section 2: Top [Service] Providers in [City]

- Cross-links between related spokes

**Avoid orphan pages**:
- Every page reachable from main site
- Logical category structure
- XML sitemap for all pages

**Breadcrumbs**:
- Show hierarchy
- Structured data markup
- User navigation aid

### 5. Indexation Strategy

**Prioritize important pages**:

## Referral vs. Affiliate: When to Use Each

### Customer Referral Programs

**Best for:**
- Existing customers recommending to their network
- Products with natural word-of-mouth
- Building authentic social proof
- Lower-ticket or self-serve products

**Characteristics:**
- Referrer is an existing customer
- Motivation: Rewards + helping friends
- Typically one-time or limited rewards
- Tracked via unique links or codes
- Higher trust, lower volume

### Affiliate Programs

**Best for:**
- Reaching audiences you don''t have access to
- Content creators, influencers, bloggers
- Products with clear value proposition
- Higher-ticket products that justify commissions

**Characteristics:**
- Affiliates may not be customers
- Motivation: Revenue/commission
- Ongoing commission relationship
- Requires more management
- Higher volume, variable trust

### Hybrid Approach

Many successful programs combine both:
- Referral program for customers (simple, small rewards)
- Affiliate program for partners (larger commissions, more structure)

│                  Reward                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 1: Identify Trigger Moments

When are customers most likely to refer?

**High-intent moments:**
- Right after first "aha" moment
- After achieving a milestone
- After receiving exceptional support
- After renewing or upgrading
- When they tell you they love the product

**Natural sharing moments:**
- When the product involves collaboration
- When they''re asked "what tool do you use?"
- When they share results publicly
- When they complete something shareable

### Step 2: Design the Share Mechanism

**Methods ranked by effectiveness:**

1. **In-product sharing** — Highest conversion, feels native
2. **Personalized link** — Easy to track, works everywhere
3. **Email invitation** — Direct, personal, higher intent
4. **Social sharing** — Broadest reach, lowest conversion
5. **Referral code** — Memorable, works offline

**Best practice:** Offer multiple sharing options, lead with the highest-converting method.

### Step 3: Choose Incentive Structure

**Single-sided rewards** (referrer only):
- Simpler to explain
- Works for high-value products
- Risk: Referred may feel no urgency

**Double-sided rewards** (both parties):
- Higher conversion rates
- Creates win-win framing
- Standard for most programs

**Tiered rewards:**
- Increases engagement over time
- Gamifies the referral process
- More complex to communicate

### Incentive Types

| Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|------|------|------|----------|
| Cash/credit | Universally valued | Feels transactional | Marketplaces, fintech |
| Product credit | Drives usage | Only valuable if they''ll use it | SaaS, subscriptions |
| Free months | Clear value | May attract freebie-seekers | Subscription products |
| Feature unlock | Low cost to you | Only works for gated features | Freemium products |
| Swag/gifts | Memorable, shareable | Logistics complexity | Brand-focused companies |
| Charity donation | Feel-good | Lower personal motivation | Mission-driven brands |

### Incentive Sizing Framework

**Calculate your maximum incentive:**
```
Max Referral Reward = (Customer LTV × Gross Margin) - Target CAC
```

**Example:**
- LTV: $1,200
- Gross margin: 70%
- Target CAC: $200
- Max reward: ($1,200 × 0.70) - $200 = $640

**Typical referral rewards:**
- B2C: $10-50 or 10-25% of first purchase
- B2B SaaS: $50-500 or 1-3 months free
- Enterprise: Higher, often custom

---

## Referral Program Examples

### Dropbox (Classic)

**Program:** Give 500MB storage, get 500MB storage
**Why it worked:**
- Reward directly tied to product value
- Low friction (just an email)
- Both parties benefit equally
- Gamified with progress tracking

### Uber/Lyft

**Program:** Give $10 ride credit, get $10 when they ride
**Why it worked:**
- Immediate, clear value
- Double-sided incentive
- Easy to share (code/link)
- Triggered at natural moments

### Morning Brew

**Program:** Tiered rewards for subscriber referrals
- 3 referrals: Newsletter stickers
- 5 referrals: T-shirt
- 10 referrals: Mug
- 25 referrals: Hoodie

**Why it worked:**
- Gamification drives ongoing engagement
- Physical rewards are shareable (more referrals)
- Low cost relative to subscriber value
- Built status/identity

### Notion

**Program:** $10 credit per referral (education)
**Why it worked:**
- Targeted high-sharing audience (students)
- Product naturally spreads in teams
- Credit keeps users engaged

---

## Affiliate Program Design

### Commission Structures

**Percentage of sale:**
- Standard: 10-30% of first sale or first year
- Works for: E-commerce, SaaS with clear pricing
- Example: "Earn 25% of every sale you refer"

**Flat fee per action:**
- Standard: $5-500 depending on value
- Works for: Lead gen, trials, freemium
- Example: "$50 for every qualified demo"

**Recurring commission:**
- Standard: 10-25% of recurring revenue
- Works for: Subscription products
- Example: "20% of subscription for 12 months"

**Tiered commission:**
- Works for: Motivating high performers
- Example: "20% for 1-10 sales, 25% for 11-25, 30% for 26+"

### Cookie Duration

How long after click does affiliate get credit?

| Duration | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| 24 hours | High-volume, low-consideration purchases |
| 7-14 days | Standard e-commerce |
| 30 days | Standard SaaS/B2B |
| 60-90 days | Long sales cycles, enterprise |
| Lifetime | Premium affiliate relationships |

### Affiliate Recruitment

**Where to find affiliates:**
- Existing customers who create content
- Industry bloggers and reviewers
- YouTubers in your niche
- Newsletter writers
- Complementary tool companies
- Consultants and agencies

**Outreach template:**
```
Subject: Partnership opportunity — [Your Product]

Hi [Name],

I''ve been following your content on [topic] — particularly [specific piece] — and think there could be a great fit for a partnership.

[Your Product] helps [audience] [achieve outcome], and I think your audience would find it valuable.

We offer [commission structure] for partners, plus [additional benefits: early access, co-marketing, etc.].

Would you be open to learning more?

[Your name]
```

### Affiliate Enablement

Provide affiliates with:
- [ ] Unique tracking links/codes
- [ ] Product overview and key benefits
- [ ] Target audience description
- [ ] Comparison to competitors
- [ ] Creative assets (logos, banners, images)
- [ ] Sample copy and talking points
- [ ] Case studies and testimonials
- [ ] Demo access or free account
- [ ] FAQ and objection handling
- [ ] Payment terms and schedule

---

## Viral Coefficient & Modeling

### Key Metrics

**Viral coefficient (K-factor):**
```
K = Invitations × Conversion Rate

K > 1 = Viral growth (each user brings more than 1 new user)
K < 1 = Amplified growth (referrals supplement other acquisition)
```

**Example:**
- Average customer sends 3 invitations
- 15% of invitations convert
- K = 3 × 0.15 = 0.45

**Referral rate:**
```
Referral Rate = (Customers who refer) / (Total customers)
```

Benchmarks:
- Good: 10-25% of customers refer
- Great: 25-50%
- Exceptional: 50%+

**Referrals per referrer:**
```
How many successful referrals does each referring customer generate?
```

Benchmarks:
- Average: 1-2 referrals per referrer
- Good: 2-5
- Exceptional: 5+

### Calculating Referral Program ROI

```
Referral Program ROI = (Revenue from referred customers - Program costs) / Program costs

Program costs = Rewards paid + Tool costs + Management time
```

**Track separately:**
- Cost per referred customer (CAC via referral)
- LTV of referred customers (often higher than average)
- Payback period for referral rewards

---

## Program Optimization

### Improving Referral Rate

**If few customers are referring:**
- Ask at better moments (after wins, not randomly)
- Simplify the sharing process
- Test different incentive types
- Make the referral prominent in product
- Remind via email campaigns
- Reduce friction in the flow

**If referrals aren''t converting:**
- Improve the landing experience for referred users
- Strengthen the incentive for new users
- Test different messaging on referral pages
- Ensure the referrer''s endorsement is visible
- Shorten the path to value

### A/B Tests to Run

**Incentive tests:**
- Reward amount (10% higher, 20% higher)
- Reward type (credit vs. cash vs. free months)
- Single vs. double-sided
- Immediate vs. delayed reward

**Messaging tests:**
- How you describe the program
- CTA copy on share buttons
- Email subject lines for referral invites
- Landing page copy for referred users

**Placement tests:**
- Where the referral prompt appears
- When it appears (trigger timing)
- How prominent it is
- In-app vs. email prompts

### Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Low awareness | Program not visible | Add prominent in-app prompts |
| Low share rate | Too much friction | Simplify to one click |
| Low conversion | Weak landing page | Optimize referred user experience |
| Fraud/abuse | Gaming the system | Add verification, limits |
| One-time referrers | No ongoing motivation | Add tiered/gamified rewards |

---

## Fraud Prevention

### Common Referral Fraud

- Self-referrals (creating fake accounts)
- Referral rings (groups referring each other)
- Coupon sites posting referral codes
- Fake email addresses
- VPN/device spoofing

### Prevention Measures

**Technical:**
- Email verification required
- Device fingerprinting
- IP address monitoring
- Delayed reward payout (after activation)
- Minimum activity threshold

**Policy:**
- Clear terms of service
- Maximum referrals per period
- Reward clawback for refunds/chargebacks
- Manual review for suspicious patterns

**Structural:**
- Require referred user to take meaningful action
- Cap lifetime rewards
- Pay rewards in product credit (less attractive to fraudsters)

---

Share [Product] with friends and earn [reward] for each person who signs up. They get [their reward] too.

[Unique referral link]

Here''s how it works:
1. Share your link
2. Friend signs up
3. You both get [reward]

[CTA: Share now]
```

### Referral Nurture Sequence

- Day 7: Remind about referral program
- Day 30: "Know anyone who''d benefit?"
- Day 60: Success story + referral prompt
- After milestone: "You just [achievement] — know others who''d want this?"

### Re-engagement for Past Referrers

```
Subject: Your friends are loving [Product]

Body:
Remember when you referred [Name]? They''ve [achievement/milestone].

Know anyone else who''d benefit? You''ll earn [reward] for each friend who joins.

[Referral link]
```

## Measuring Success

### Dashboard Metrics

**Program health:**
- Active referrers (referred someone in last 30 days)
- Total referrals (invites sent)
- Referral conversion rate
- Rewards earned/paid

**Business impact:**
- % of new customers from referrals
- CAC via referral vs. other channels

## Quick Start Example

```tsx
import { useCurrentFrame, useVideoConfig, interpolate } from "remotion";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();
  const { fps } = useVideoConfig();

  const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0, 2 * fps], [0, 1], {
    extrapolateRight: ''clamp'',
  });

  return (
    <div style={{ opacity }}>
      <h1>Hello Remotion!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use `useCurrentFrame()`** - Drive all animations from the current frame
2. **Avoid CSS animations** - They won''t render correctly in videos
3. **Think in seconds** - Multiply time in seconds by `fps` for frame calculations
4. **Use interpolate for smooth animations** - Built-in interpolation with easing functions
5. **Clamp extrapolation** - Prevent values from exceeding intended ranges
6. **Test frequently** - Preview in Remotion Studio before rendering

# Schema Markup

You are an expert in structured data and schema markup. Your goal is to implement schema.org markup that helps search engines understand content and enables rich results in search.

## Initial Assessment

Before implementing schema, understand:

1. **Page Type**
   - What kind of page is this?
   - What''s the primary content?
   - What rich results are possible?

2. **Current State**
   - Any existing schema?
   - Errors in current implementation?
   - Which rich results are already appearing?

3. **Goals**
   - Which rich results are you targeting?
   - What''s the business value?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy First
- Schema must accurately represent page content
- Don''t markup content that doesn''t exist
- Keep updated when content changes

### 2. Use JSON-LD
- Google recommends JSON-LD format
- Easier to implement and maintain
- Place in `<head>` or end of `<body>`

### 3. Follow Google''s Guidelines
- Only use markup Google supports
- Avoid spam tactics
- Review eligibility requirements

### 4. Validate Everything
- Test before deploying
- Monitor Search Console
- Fix errors promptly

## Validation and Testing

### Tools
- **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org/
- **Search Console**: Enhancements reports

### Common Errors

**Missing required properties**
- Check Google''s documentation for required fields
- Different from schema.org minimum requirements

**Invalid values**
- Dates must be ISO 8601 format
- URLs must be fully qualified
- Enumerations must use exact values

**Mismatch with page content**
- Schema doesn''t match visible content
- Ratings for products without reviews shown
- Prices that don''t match displayed prices

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Static Sites
- Add JSON-LD directly in HTML template
- Use includes/partials for reusable schema

### Dynamic Sites (React, Next.js, etc.)
- Component that renders schema
- Server-side rendered for SEO
- Serialize data to JSON-LD

```jsx
// Next.js example
export default function ProductPage({ product }) {
  const schema = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Product",
    name: product.name,
    // ... other properties
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <script
          type="application/ld+json"
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }}
        />
      </Head>
      {/* Page content */}
    </>
  );
}
```

### CMS / WordPress
- Plugins (Yoast, Rank Math, Schema Pro)
- Theme modifications
- Custom fields to structured data

---

## Output Format

### Schema Implementation
```json
// Full JSON-LD code block
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "...",
  // Complete markup
}
```

### Placement Instructions
Where to add the code and how

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Validates in Rich Results Test
- [ ] No errors or warnings
- [ ] Matches page content
- [ ] All required properties included

---

## Questions to Ask

If you need more context:
1. What type of page is this?
2. What rich results are you hoping to achieve?
3. What data is available to populate the schema?
4. Is there existing schema on the page?
5. What''s your tech stack for implementation?

# Signup Flow CRO

You are an expert in optimizing signup and registration flows. Your goal is to reduce friction, increase completion rates, and set users up for successful activation.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Flow Type**
   - Free trial signup
   - Freemium account creation
   - Paid account creation
   - Waitlist/early access signup
   - B2B vs B2C

2. **Current State**
   - How many steps/screens?
   - What fields are required?
   - What''s the current completion rate?
   - Where do users drop off?

3. **Business Constraints**
   - What data is genuinely needed at signup?
   - Are there compliance requirements?
   - What happens immediately after signup?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Minimize Required Fields
Every field reduces conversion. For each field, ask:
- Do we absolutely need this before they can use the product?
- Can we collect this later through progressive profiling?
- Can we infer this from other data?

**Typical field priority:**
- Essential: Email (or phone), Password
- Often needed: Name
- Usually deferrable: Company, Role, Team size, Phone, Address

### 2. Show Value Before Asking for Commitment
- What can you show/give before requiring signup?
- Can they experience the product before creating an account?
- Reverse the order: value first, signup second

### 3. Reduce Perceived Effort
- Show progress if multi-step
- Group related fields
- Use smart defaults
- Pre-fill when possible

### 4. Remove Uncertainty
- Clear expectations ("Takes 30 seconds")
- Show what happens after signup
- No surprises (hidden requirements, unexpected steps)

---

## Field-by-Field Optimization

### Email Field
- Single field (no email confirmation field)
- Inline validation for format
- Check for common typos (gmial.com → gmail.com)
- Clear error messages

### Password Field
- Show password toggle (eye icon)
- Show requirements upfront, not after failure
- Consider passphrase hints for strength
- Update requirement indicators in real-time

**Better password UX:**
- Allow paste (don''t disable)
- Show strength meter instead of rigid rules
- Consider passwordless options

### Name Field
- Single "Full name" field vs. First/Last split (test this)
- Only require if immediately used (personalization)
- Consider making optional

### Social Auth Options
- Place prominently (often higher conversion than email)
- Show most relevant options for your audience
  - B2C: Google, Apple, Facebook
  - B2B: Google, Microsoft, SSO
- Clear visual separation from email signup
- Consider "Sign up with Google" as primary

### Phone Number
- Defer unless essential (SMS verification, calling leads)
- If required, explain why
- Use proper input type with country code handling
- Format as they type

### Company/Organization
- Defer if possible
- Auto-suggest as they type
- Infer from email domain when possible

### Use Case / Role Questions
- Defer to onboarding if possible
- If needed at signup, keep to one question
- Use progressive disclosure (don''t show all options at once)

---

## Single-Step vs. Multi-Step

### Single-Step Works When:
- 3 or fewer fields
- Simple B2C products
- High-intent visitors (from ads, waitlist)

### Multi-Step Works When:
- More than 3-4 fields needed
- Complex B2B products needing segmentation
- You need to collect different types of info

### Multi-Step Best Practices
- Show progress indicator
- Lead with easy questions (name, email)
- Put harder questions later (after psychological commitment)
- Each step should feel completable in seconds
- Allow back navigation
- Save progress (don''t lose data on refresh)

**Progressive commitment pattern:**
1. Email only (lowest barrier)
2. Password + name
3. Customization questions (optional)

---

## Trust and Friction Reduction

### At the Form Level
- "No credit card required" (if true)
- "Free forever" or "14-day free trial"
- Privacy note: "We''ll never share your email"
- Security badges if relevant
- Testimonial near signup form

### Error Handling
- Inline validation (not just on submit)
- Specific error messages ("Email already registered" + recovery path)
- Don''t clear the form on error
- Focus on the problem field

### Microcopy
- Placeholder text: Use for examples, not labels
- Labels: Always visible (not just placeholders)
- Help text: Only when needed, placed close to field

---

## Mobile Signup Optimization

- Larger touch targets (44px+ height)
- Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, etc.)
- Autofill support
- Reduce typing (social auth, pre-fill)
- Single column layout
- Sticky CTA button
- Test with actual devices

---

## Post-Submit Experience

### Success State
- Clear confirmation
- Immediate next step
- If email verification required:
  - Explain what to do
  - Easy resend option
  - Check spam reminder
  - Option to change email if wrong

### Verification Flows
- Consider delaying verification until necessary
- Magic link as alternative to password
- Let users explore while awaiting verification
- Clear re-engagement if verification stalls

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics
- Form start rate (landed → started filling)
- Form completion rate (started → submitted)
- Field-level drop-off (which fields lose people)
- Time to complete
- Error rate by field
- Mobile vs. desktop completion

### What to Track
- Each field interaction (focus, blur, error)
- Step progression in multi-step
- Social auth vs. email signup ratio
- Time between steps

---

## Output Format

### Audit Findings
For each issue found:
- **Issue**: What''s wrong
- **Impact**: Why it matters (with estimated impact if possible)
- **Fix**: Specific recommendation
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low

### Recommended Changes
Organized by:
1. Quick wins (same-day fixes)
2. High-impact changes (week-level effort)
3. Test hypotheses (things to A/B test)

### Form Redesign (if requested)
- Recommended field set with rationale
- Field order
- Copy for labels, placeholders, buttons, errors
- Visual layout suggestions

---

## Common Signup Flow Patterns

### B2B SaaS Trial
1. Email + Password (or Google auth)
2. Name + Company (optional: role)
3. → Onboarding flow

### B2C App
1. Google/Apple auth OR Email
2. → Product experience
3. Profile completion later

### Waitlist/Early Access
1. Email only
2. Optional: Role/use case question
3. → Waitlist confirmation

### E-commerce Account
1. Guest checkout as default
2. Account creation optional post-purchase
3. OR Social auth with single click

| Interview | TikTok | Short clip with caption |
| Interview | YouTube | Shorts from best moments |

### Repurposing Workflow

1. **Create pillar content** (blog, video, podcast)
2. **Extract key insights** (3-5 per piece)
3. **Adapt to each platform** (format and tone)
4. **Schedule across the week** (spread distribution)
5. **Update and reshare** (evergreen content can repeat)

---

## Content Calendar Structure

### Weekly Planning Template

| Day | LinkedIn | Twitter/X | Instagram |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Mon | Industry insight | Thread | Carousel |
| Tue | Behind-scenes | Engagement | Story |
| Wed | Educational | Tips tweet | Reel |
| Thu | Story post | Thread | Educational |
| Fri | Hot take | Engagement | Story |
| Sat | — | Curated RT | User content |
| Sun | — | Personal | Behind-scenes |

### Monthly Content Mix

- Week 1: Launch/announce something (if applicable)
- Week 2: Educational deep-dive
- Week 3: Community/engagement focus
- Week 4: Story/behind-the-scenes

### Batching Strategy

**Weekly batching (2-3 hours):**
1. Review content pillar topics
2. Write 5 LinkedIn posts
3. Write 3 Twitter threads + daily tweets
4. Create Instagram carousel + Reel ideas
5. Schedule everything
6. Leave room for real-time engagement

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Proactive Engagement

Engagement isn''t just responding—it''s actively participating:

**Daily engagement routine (30 min):**
1. Respond to all comments on your posts (5 min)
2. Comment on 5-10 posts from target accounts (15 min)
3. Share/repost with added insight (5 min)
4. Send 2-3 DMs to new connections (5 min)

**Quality comments:**
- Add new insight, not just "Great post!"
- Share a related experience
- Ask a thoughtful follow-up question
- Respectfully disagree with nuance

### Building Relationships

- Identify 20-50 accounts in your space
- Consistently engage with their content
- Share their content with credit
- Eventually collaborate (podcasts, co-created content)

### Handling Negative Comments

- Respond calmly and professionally
- Don''t get defensive
- Take legitimate criticism offline
- Block/mute trolls without engaging
- Let community defend you when appropriate

---

## Analytics & Optimization

### Metrics That Matter

**Awareness:**
- Impressions
- Reach
- Follower growth rate

**Engagement:**
- Engagement rate (engagements / impressions)
- Comments (higher value than likes)
- Shares/reposts
- Saves (Instagram)

**Conversion:**
- Link clicks
- Profile visits
- DMs received
- Leads/conversions attributed

### What to Track Weekly

- [ ] Top 3 performing posts (why did they work?)
- [ ] Bottom 3 posts (what can you learn?)
- [ ] Follower growth trend
- [ ] Engagement rate trend
- [ ] Best posting times (from data)
- [ ] Content pillar performance

### Optimization Actions

**If engagement is low:**
- Test new hooks
- Post at different times
- Try different formats (carousel vs. text)
- Increase native engagement with others
- Check if content matches audience interest

**If reach is declining:**
- Avoid external links in post body
- Increase posting frequency slightly
- Engage more in comments
- Test video/visual content
- Check for algorithm changes

---

## Platform-Specific Tips

### LinkedIn Algorithm Tips

- First hour engagement matters most
- Comments > reactions > clicks
- Dwell time (people reading) signals quality
- No external links in post body
- Document posts (carousels) get strong reach
- Polls drive engagement but don''t build authority

### Twitter/X Algorithm Tips

- Replies and quote tweets build authority
- Threads keep people on platform (rewarded)
- Images and video get more reach
- Engagement in first 30 min matters
- Twitter Blue/Premium may boost reach

### Instagram Algorithm Tips

- Reels heavily prioritized over static posts
- Saves and shares > likes
- Stories keep you top of feed
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Use all features (polls, questions, etc.)

---

## Reverse Engineering Viral Content

Instead of guessing what works, systematically analyze top-performing content in your niche and extract proven patterns.

### The 6-Step Framework

#### 1. NICHE ID — Find Top Creators

Identify 10-20 creators in your space who consistently get high engagement:

**Selection criteria:**
- Posting consistently (3+ times/week)
- High engagement rate relative to follower count
- Audience overlap with your target market
- Mix of established and rising creators

**Where to find them:**
- LinkedIn: Search by industry keywords, check "People also viewed"
- Twitter/X: Check who your target audience follows and engages with
- Use tools like SparkToro, Followerwonk, or manual research
- Look at who gets featured in industry newsletters

#### 2. SCRAPE — Collect Posts at Scale

Gather 500-1000+ posts from your identified creators for analysis:

**Tools:**
- **Apify** — LinkedIn scraper, Twitter scraper actors
- **Phantom Buster** — Multi-platform automation
- **Export tools** — Platform-specific export features
- **Manual collection** — For smaller datasets, copy/paste into spreadsheet

**Data to collect:**
- Post text/content
- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, saves)
- Post format (text-only, carousel, video, image)
- Posting time/day
- Hook/first line
- CTA used
- Topic/theme

#### 3. ANALYZE — Extract What Actually Works

Sort and analyze the data to find patterns:

**Quantitative analysis:**
- Rank posts by engagement rate
- Identify top 10% performers
- Look for format patterns (do carousels outperform?)
- Check timing patterns (best days/times)
- Compare topic performance

**Qualitative analysis:**
- What hooks do top posts use?
- How long are high-performing posts?
- What emotional triggers appear?
- What formats repeat?
- What topics consistently perform?

**Questions to answer:**
- What''s the average length of top posts?
- Which hook types appear most in top 10%?
- What CTAs drive most comments?
- What topics get saved/shared most?

#### 4. PLAYBOOK — Codify Patterns

Document repeatable patterns you can use:

**Hook patterns to codify:**
```
Pattern: "I [unexpected action] and [surprising result]"
Example: "I stopped posting daily and my engagement doubled"
Why it works: Curiosity gap + contrarian

Pattern: "[Specific number] [things] that [outcome]:"
Example: "7 pricing mistakes that cost me $50K:"
Why it works: Specificity + loss aversion

Pattern: "[Controversial take]"
Example: "Cold outreach is dead."
Why it works: Pattern interrupt + invites debate
```

**Format patterns:**
- Carousel: Hook slide → Problem → Solution steps → CTA
- Thread: Hook → Promise → Deliver → Recap → CTA
- Story post: Hook → Setup → Conflict → Resolution → Lesson

**CTA patterns:**
- Question: "What would you add?"
- Agreement: "Agree or disagree?"
- Share: "Tag someone who needs this"
- Save: "Save this for later"

#### 5. LAYER VOICE — Apply Direct Response Principles

Take proven patterns and make them yours with these voice principles:

**"Smart friend who figured something out"**
- Write like you''re texting advice to a friend
- Share discoveries, not lectures
- Use "I found that..." not "You should..."
- Be helpful, not preachy

**Specific > Vague**
```
❌ "I made good revenue"
✅ "I made $47,329"

❌ "It took a while"
✅ "It took 47 days"

❌ "A lot of people"
✅ "2,847 people"
```

**Short. Breathe. Land.**
- One idea per sentence
- Use line breaks liberally
- Let important points stand alone
- Create rhythm: short, short, longer explanation

```
❌ "I spent three years building my business the wrong way before I finally realized that the key to success was focusing on fewer things and doing them exceptionally well."

✅ "I built wrong for 3 years.

Then I figured it out.

Focus on less.
Do it exceptionally well.

Everything changed."
```

**Write from emotion**
- Start with how you felt, not what you did
- Use emotional words: frustrated, excited, terrified, obsessed
- Show vulnerability when authentic
- Connect the feeling to the lesson

```
❌ "Here''s what I learned about pricing"

✅ "I was terrified to raise my prices.

My hands were shaking when I sent the email.

Here''s what happened..."
```

#### 6. CONVERT — Turn Attention into Action

Bridge from engagement to business results:

**Soft conversions:**
- Newsletter signups in bio/comments
- Free resource offers in follow-up comments
- DM triggers ("Comment X and I''ll send you...")
- Profile visits → optimized profile with clear CTA

**Direct conversions:**
- Link in comments (not post body on LinkedIn)
- Contextual product mentions within valuable content
- Case study posts that naturally showcase your work
- "If you want help with this, DM me" (sparingly)

### Output: Proven Patterns + Right Voice = Performance

The formula:
```
1. Find what''s already working (don''t guess)
2. Extract the patterns (hooks, formats, CTAs)
3. Layer your authentic voice on top
4. Test and iterate based on your own data
```

# Three.js Animation

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

// Simple procedural animation
const clock = new THREE.Clock();

function animate() {
  const delta = clock.getDelta();
  const elapsed = clock.getElapsedTime();

  mesh.rotation.y += delta;
  mesh.position.y = Math.sin(elapsed) * 0.5;

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

## Animation System Overview

Three.js animation system has three main components:

1. **AnimationClip** - Container for keyframe data
2. **AnimationMixer** - Plays animations on a root object
3. **AnimationAction** - Controls playback of a clip

## AnimationClip

Stores keyframe animation data.

```javascript
// Create animation clip
const times = [0, 1, 2]; // Keyframe times (seconds)
const values = [0, 1, 0]; // Values at each keyframe

const track = new THREE.NumberKeyframeTrack(
  ".position[y]", // Property path
  times,
  values,
);

const clip = new THREE.AnimationClip("bounce", 2, [track]);
```

### KeyframeTrack Types

```javascript
// Number track (single value)
new THREE.NumberKeyframeTrack(".opacity", times, [1, 0]);
new THREE.NumberKeyframeTrack(".material.opacity", times, [1, 0]);

// Vector track (position, scale)
new THREE.VectorKeyframeTrack(".position", times, [
  0,
  0,
  0, // t=0
  1,
  2,
  0, // t=1
  0,
  0,
  0, // t=2
]);

// Quaternion track (rotation)
const q1 = new THREE.Quaternion().setFromEuler(new THREE.Euler(0, 0, 0));
const q2 = new THREE.Quaternion().setFromEuler(new THREE.Euler(0, Math.PI, 0));
new THREE.QuaternionKeyframeTrack(
  ".quaternion",
  [0, 1],
  [q1.x, q1.y, q1.z, q1.w, q2.x, q2.y, q2.z, q2.w],
);

// Color track
new THREE.ColorKeyframeTrack(".material.color", times, [
  1,
  0,
  0, // red
  0,
  1,
  0, // green
  0,
  0,
  1, // blue
]);

// Boolean track
new THREE.BooleanKeyframeTrack(".visible", [0, 0.5, 1], [true, false, true]);

// String track (for morph targets)
new THREE.StringKeyframeTrack(
  ".morphTargetInfluences[smile]",
  [0, 1],
  ["0", "1"],
);
```

### Interpolation Modes

```javascript
const track = new THREE.VectorKeyframeTrack(".position", times, values);

// Interpolation
track.setInterpolation(THREE.InterpolateLinear); // Default
track.setInterpolation(THREE.InterpolateSmooth); // Cubic spline
track.setInterpolation(THREE.InterpolateDiscrete); // Step function
```

## AnimationMixer

Plays animations on an object and its descendants.

```javascript
const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(model);

// Create action from clip
const action = mixer.clipAction(clip);
action.play();

// Update in animation loop
function animate() {
  const delta = clock.getDelta();
  mixer.update(delta); // Required!

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

### Mixer Events

```javascript
mixer.addEventListener("finished", (e) => {
  console.log("Animation finished:", e.action.getClip().name);
});

mixer.addEventListener("loop", (e) => {
  console.log("Animation looped:", e.action.getClip().name);
});
```

## AnimationAction

Controls playback of an animation clip.

```javascript
const action = mixer.clipAction(clip);

// Playback control
action.play();
action.stop();
action.reset();
action.halt(fadeOutDuration);

// Playback state
action.isRunning();
action.isScheduled();

// Time control
action.time = 0.5; // Current time
action.timeScale = 1; // Playback speed (negative = reverse)
action.paused = false;

// Weight (for blending)
action.weight = 1; // 0-1, contribution to final pose
action.setEffectiveWeight(1);

// Loop modes
action.loop = THREE.LoopRepeat; // Default: loop forever
action.loop = THREE.LoopOnce; // Play once and stop
action.loop = THREE.LoopPingPong; // Alternate forward/backward
action.repetitions = 3; // Number of loops (Infinity default)

// Clamping
action.clampWhenFinished = true; // Hold last frame when done

// Blending
action.blendMode = THREE.NormalAnimationBlendMode;
action.blendMode = THREE.AdditiveAnimationBlendMode;
```

### Fade In/Out

```javascript
// Fade in
action.reset().fadeIn(0.5).play();

// Fade out
action.fadeOut(0.5);

// Crossfade between animations
const action1 = mixer.clipAction(clip1);
const action2 = mixer.clipAction(clip2);

action1.play();

// Later, crossfade to action2
action1.crossFadeTo(action2, 0.5, true);
action2.play();
```

## Loading GLTF Animations

Most common source of skeletal animations.

```javascript
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load("model.glb", (gltf) => {
  const model = gltf.scene;
  scene.add(model);

  // Create mixer
  const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(model);

  // Get all clips
  const clips = gltf.animations;
  console.log(
    "Available animations:",
    clips.map((c) => c.name),
  );

  // Play first animation
  if (clips.length > 0) {
    const action = mixer.clipAction(clips[0]);
    action.play();
  }

  // Play specific animation by name
  const walkClip = THREE.AnimationClip.findByName(clips, "Walk");
  if (walkClip) {
    mixer.clipAction(walkClip).play();
  }

  // Store mixer for update loop
  window.mixer = mixer;
});

// Animation loop
function animate() {
  const delta = clock.getDelta();
  if (window.mixer) window.mixer.update(delta);

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

## Skeletal Animation

### Skeleton and Bones

```javascript
// Access skeleton from skinned mesh
const skinnedMesh = model.getObjectByProperty("type", "SkinnedMesh");
const skeleton = skinnedMesh.skeleton;

// Access bones
skeleton.bones.forEach((bone) => {
  console.log(bone.name, bone.position, bone.rotation);
});

// Find specific bone by name
const headBone = skeleton.bones.find((b) => b.name === "Head");
if (headBone) headBone.rotation.y = Math.PI / 4; // Turn head

// Skeleton helper
const helper = new THREE.SkeletonHelper(model);
scene.add(helper);
```

### Programmatic Bone Animation

```javascript
function animate() {
  const time = clock.getElapsedTime();

  // Animate bone
  const headBone = skeleton.bones.find((b) => b.name === "Head");
  if (headBone) {
    headBone.rotation.y = Math.sin(time) * 0.3;
  }

  // Update mixer if also playing clips
  mixer.update(clock.getDelta());
}
```

### Bone Attachments

```javascript
// Attach object to bone
const weapon = new THREE.Mesh(weaponGeometry, weaponMaterial);
const handBone = skeleton.bones.find((b) => b.name === "RightHand");
if (handBone) handBone.add(weapon);

// Offset attachment
weapon.position.set(0, 0, 0.5);
weapon.rotation.set(0, Math.PI / 2, 0);
```

## Morph Targets

Blend between different mesh shapes.

```javascript
// Morph targets are stored in geometry
const geometry = mesh.geometry;
console.log("Morph attributes:", Object.keys(geometry.morphAttributes));

// Access morph target influences
mesh.morphTargetInfluences; // Array of weights
mesh.morphTargetDictionary; // Name -> index mapping

// Set morph target by index
mesh.morphTargetInfluences[0] = 0.5;

// Set by name
const smileIndex = mesh.morphTargetDictionary["smile"];
mesh.morphTargetInfluences[smileIndex] = 1;
```

### Animating Morph Targets

```javascript
// Procedural
function animate() {
  const t = clock.getElapsedTime();
  mesh.morphTargetInfluences[0] = (Math.sin(t) + 1) / 2;
}

// With keyframe animation
const track = new THREE.NumberKeyframeTrack(
  ".morphTargetInfluences[smile]",
  [0, 0.5, 1],
  [0, 1, 0],
);
const clip = new THREE.AnimationClip("smile", 1, [track]);
mixer.clipAction(clip).play();
```

## Animation Blending

Mix multiple animations together.

```javascript
// Setup actions
const idleAction = mixer.clipAction(idleClip);
const walkAction = mixer.clipAction(walkClip);
const runAction = mixer.clipAction(runClip);

// Play all with different weights
idleAction.play();
walkAction.play();
runAction.play();

// Set initial weights
idleAction.setEffectiveWeight(1);
walkAction.setEffectiveWeight(0);
runAction.setEffectiveWeight(0);

// Blend based on speed
function updateAnimations(speed) {
  if (speed < 0.1) {
    idleAction.setEffectiveWeight(1);
    walkAction.setEffectiveWeight(0);
    runAction.setEffectiveWeight(0);
  } else if (speed < 5) {
    const t = speed / 5;
    idleAction.setEffectiveWeight(1 - t);
    walkAction.setEffectiveWeight(t);
    runAction.setEffectiveWeight(0);
  } else {
    const t = Math.min((speed - 5) / 5, 1);
    idleAction.setEffectiveWeight(0);
    walkAction.setEffectiveWeight(1 - t);
    runAction.setEffectiveWeight(t);
  }
}
```

### Additive Blending

```javascript
// Base pose
const baseAction = mixer.clipAction(baseClip);
baseAction.play();

// Additive layer (e.g., breathing)
const additiveAction = mixer.clipAction(additiveClip);
additiveAction.blendMode = THREE.AdditiveAnimationBlendMode;
additiveAction.play();

// Convert clip to additive
THREE.AnimationUtils.makeClipAdditive(additiveClip);
```

## Animation Utilities

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

// Find clip by name
const clip = THREE.AnimationClip.findByName(clips, "Walk");

// Create subclip
const subclip = THREE.AnimationUtils.subclip(clip, "subclip", 0, 30, 30);

// Convert to additive
THREE.AnimationUtils.makeClipAdditive(clip);
THREE.AnimationUtils.makeClipAdditive(clip, 0, referenceClip);

// Clone clip
const clone = clip.clone();

// Get clip duration
clip.duration;

// Optimize clip (remove redundant keyframes)
clip.optimize();

// Reset clip to first frame
clip.resetDuration();
```

## Procedural Animation Patterns

### Smooth Damping

```javascript
// Smooth follow/lerp
const target = new THREE.Vector3();
const current = new THREE.Vector3();
const velocity = new THREE.Vector3();

function smoothDamp(current, target, velocity, smoothTime, deltaTime) {
  const omega = 2 / smoothTime;
  const x = omega * deltaTime;
  const exp = 1 / (1 + x + 0.48 * x * x + 0.235 * x * x * x);
  const change = current.clone().sub(target);
  const temp = velocity
    .clone()
    .add(change.clone().multiplyScalar(omega))
    .multiplyScalar(deltaTime);
  velocity.sub(temp.clone().multiplyScalar(omega)).multiplyScalar(exp);
  return target.clone().add(change.add(temp).multiplyScalar(exp));
}

function animate() {
  current.copy(smoothDamp(current, target, velocity, 0.3, delta));
  mesh.position.copy(current);
}
```

### Spring Physics

```javascript
class Spring {
  constructor(stiffness = 100, damping = 10) {
    this.stiffness = stiffness;
    this.damping = damping;
    this.position = 0;
    this.velocity = 0;
    this.target = 0;
  }

  update(dt) {
    const force = -this.stiffness * (this.position - this.target);
    const dampingForce = -this.damping * this.velocity;
    this.velocity += (force + dampingForce) * dt;
    this.position += this.velocity * dt;
    return this.position;
  }
}

const spring = new Spring(100, 10);
spring.target = 1;

function animate() {
  mesh.position.y = spring.update(delta);
}
```

### Oscillation

```javascript
function animate() {
  const t = clock.getElapsedTime();

  // Sine wave
  mesh.position.y = Math.sin(t * 2) * 0.5;

  // Bouncing
  mesh.position.y = Math.abs(Math.sin(t * 3)) * 2;

  // Circular motion
  mesh.position.x = Math.cos(t) * 2;
  mesh.position.z = Math.sin(t) * 2;

  // Figure 8
  mesh.position.x = Math.sin(t) * 2;
  mesh.position.z = Math.sin(t * 2) * 1;
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Share clips**: Same AnimationClip can be used on multiple mixers
2. **Optimize clips**: Call `clip.optimize()` to remove redundant keyframes
3. **Disable when off-screen**: Stop mixer updates for invisible objects
4. **Use LOD for animations**: Simpler rigs for distant characters
5. **Limit active mixers**: Each mixer.update() has a cost

```javascript
// Pause animation when not visible
mesh.onBeforeRender = () => {
  action.paused = false;
};

mesh.onAfterRender = () => {
  // Check if will be visible next frame
  if (!isInFrustum(mesh)) {
    action.paused = true;
  }
};

// Cache clips
const clipCache = new Map();
function getClip(name) {
  if (!clipCache.has(name)) {
    clipCache.set(name, loadClip(name));
  }
  return clipCache.get(name);
}
```

# Three.js Fundamentals

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

// Create scene, camera, renderer
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  75,
  window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
  0.1,
  1000,
);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });

renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2));
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Add a mesh
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

// Add light
scene.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.5));
const dirLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);
dirLight.position.set(5, 5, 5);
scene.add(dirLight);

camera.position.z = 5;

// Animation loop
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();

// Handle resize
window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
});
```

## Core Classes

### Scene

Container for all 3D objects, lights, and cameras.

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
scene.background = new THREE.Color(0x000000); // Solid color
scene.background = texture; // Skybox texture
scene.background = cubeTexture; // Cubemap
scene.environment = envMap; // Environment map for PBR
scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(0xffffff, 1, 100); // Linear fog
scene.fog = new THREE.FogExp2(0xffffff, 0.02); // Exponential fog
```

### Cameras

**PerspectiveCamera** - Most common, simulates human eye.

```javascript
// PerspectiveCamera(fov, aspect, near, far)
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  75, // Field of view (degrees)
  window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, // Aspect ratio
  0.1, // Near clipping plane
  1000, // Far clipping plane
);

camera.position.set(0, 5, 10);
camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); // Call after changing fov, aspect, near, far
```

**OrthographicCamera** - No perspective distortion, good for 2D/isometric.

```javascript
// OrthographicCamera(left, right, top, bottom, near, far)
const aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
const frustumSize = 10;
const camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(
  (frustumSize * aspect) / -2,
  (frustumSize * aspect) / 2,
  frustumSize / 2,
  frustumSize / -2,
  0.1,
  1000,
);
```

**ArrayCamera** - Multiple viewports with sub-cameras.

```javascript
const cameras = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  const subcamera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(40, 1, 0.1, 100);
  subcamera.viewport = new THREE.Vector4(
    Math.floor(i % 2) * 0.5,
    Math.floor(i / 2) * 0.5,
    0.5,
    0.5,
  );
  cameras.push(subcamera);
}
const arrayCamera = new THREE.ArrayCamera(cameras);
```

**CubeCamera** - Renders environment maps for reflections.

```javascript
const cubeRenderTarget = new THREE.WebGLCubeRenderTarget(256);
const cubeCamera = new THREE.CubeCamera(0.1, 1000, cubeRenderTarget);
scene.add(cubeCamera);

// Use for reflections
material.envMap = cubeRenderTarget.texture;

// Update each frame (expensive!)
cubeCamera.position.copy(reflectiveMesh.position);
cubeCamera.update(renderer, scene);
```

### WebGLRenderer

```javascript
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
  canvas: document.querySelector("#canvas"), // Optional existing canvas
  antialias: true, // Smooth edges
  alpha: true, // Transparent background
  powerPreference: "high-performance", // GPU hint
  preserveDrawingBuffer: true, // For screenshots
});

renderer.setSize(width, height);
renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2));

// Tone mapping
renderer.toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping;
renderer.toneMappingExposure = 1.0;

// Color space (Three.js r152+)
renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;

// Shadows
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;
renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap;

// Clear color
renderer.setClearColor(0x000000, 1);

// Render
renderer.render(scene, camera);
```

### Object3D

Base class for all 3D objects. Mesh, Group, Light, Camera all extend Object3D.

```javascript
const obj = new THREE.Object3D();

// Transform
obj.position.set(x, y, z);
obj.rotation.set(x, y, z); // Euler angles (radians)
obj.quaternion.set(x, y, z, w); // Quaternion rotation
obj.scale.set(x, y, z);

// Local vs World transforms
obj.getWorldPosition(targetVector);
obj.getWorldQuaternion(targetQuaternion);
obj.getWorldDirection(targetVector);

// Hierarchy
obj.add(child);
obj.remove(child);
obj.parent;
obj.children;

// Visibility
obj.visible = false;

// Layers (for selective rendering/raycasting)
obj.layers.set(1);
obj.layers.enable(2);
obj.layers.disable(0);

// Traverse hierarchy
obj.traverse((child) => {
  if (child.isMesh) child.material.color.set(0xff0000);
});

// Matrix updates
obj.matrixAutoUpdate = true; // Default: auto-update matrices
obj.updateMatrix(); // Manual matrix update
obj.updateMatrixWorld(true); // Update world matrix recursively
```

### Group

Empty container for organizing objects.

```javascript
const group = new THREE.Group();
group.add(mesh1);
group.add(mesh2);
scene.add(group);

// Transform entire group
group.position.x = 5;
group.rotation.y = Math.PI / 4;
```

### Mesh

Combines geometry and material.

```javascript
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

// Multiple materials (one per geometry group)
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, [material1, material2]);

// Useful properties
mesh.geometry;
mesh.material;
mesh.castShadow = true;
mesh.receiveShadow = true;

// Frustum culling
mesh.frustumCulled = true; // Default: skip if outside camera view

// Render order
mesh.renderOrder = 10; // Higher = rendered later
```

## Coordinate System

Three.js uses a **right-handed coordinate system**:

- **+X** points right
- **+Y** points up
- **+Z** points toward viewer (out of screen)

```javascript
// Axes helper
const axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper(5);
scene.add(axesHelper); // Red=X, Green=Y, Blue=Z
```

## Math Utilities

### Vector3

```javascript
const v = new THREE.Vector3(x, y, z);
v.set(x, y, z);
v.copy(otherVector);
v.clone();

// Operations (modify in place)
v.add(v2);
v.sub(v2);
v.multiply(v2);
v.multiplyScalar(2);
v.divideScalar(2);
v.normalize();
v.negate();
v.clamp(min, max);
v.lerp(target, alpha);

// Calculations (return new value)
v.length();
v.lengthSq(); // Faster than length()
v.distanceTo(v2);
v.dot(v2);
v.cross(v2); // Modifies v
v.angleTo(v2);

// Transform
v.applyMatrix4(matrix);
v.applyQuaternion(q);
v.project(camera); // World to NDC
v.unproject(camera); // NDC to world
```

### Matrix4

```javascript
const m = new THREE.Matrix4();
m.identity();
m.copy(other);
m.clone();

// Build transforms
m.makeTranslation(x, y, z);
m.makeRotationX(theta);
m.makeRotationY(theta);
m.makeRotationZ(theta);
m.makeRotationFromQuaternion(q);
m.makeScale(x, y, z);

// Compose/decompose
m.compose(position, quaternion, scale);
m.decompose(position, quaternion, scale);

// Operations
m.multiply(m2); // m = m * m2
m.premultiply(m2); // m = m2 * m
m.invert();
m.transpose();

// Camera matrices
m.makePerspective(left, right, top, bottom, near, far);
m.makeOrthographic(left, right, top, bottom, near, far);
m.lookAt(eye, target, up);
```

### Quaternion

```javascript
const q = new THREE.Quaternion();
q.setFromEuler(euler);
q.setFromAxisAngle(axis, angle);
q.setFromRotationMatrix(matrix);

q.multiply(q2);
q.slerp(target, t); // Spherical interpolation
q.normalize();
q.invert();
```

### Euler

```javascript
const euler = new THREE.Euler(x, y, z, "XYZ"); // Order matters!
euler.setFromQuaternion(q);
euler.setFromRotationMatrix(m);

// Rotation orders: ''XYZ'', ''YXZ'', ''ZXY'', ''XZY'', ''YZX'', ''ZYX''
```

### Color

```javascript
const color = new THREE.Color(0xff0000);
const color = new THREE.Color("red");
const color = new THREE.Color("rgb(255, 0, 0)");
const color = new THREE.Color("#ff0000");

color.setHex(0x00ff00);
color.setRGB(r, g, b); // 0-1 range
color.setHSL(h, s, l); // 0-1 range

color.lerp(otherColor, alpha);
color.multiply(otherColor);
color.multiplyScalar(2);
```

### MathUtils

```javascript
THREE.MathUtils.clamp(value, min, max);
THREE.MathUtils.lerp(start, end, alpha);
THREE.MathUtils.mapLinear(value, inMin, inMax, outMin, outMax);
THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(degrees);
THREE.MathUtils.radToDeg(radians);
THREE.MathUtils.randFloat(min, max);
THREE.MathUtils.randInt(min, max);
THREE.MathUtils.smoothstep(x, min, max);
THREE.MathUtils.smootherstep(x, min, max);
```

## Common Patterns

### Proper Cleanup

```javascript
function dispose() {
  // Dispose geometries
  mesh.geometry.dispose();

  // Dispose materials
  if (Array.isArray(mesh.material)) {
    mesh.material.forEach((m) => m.dispose());
  } else {
    mesh.material.dispose();
  }

  // Dispose textures
  texture.dispose();

  // Remove from scene
  scene.remove(mesh);

  // Dispose renderer
  renderer.dispose();
}
```

### Clock for Animation

```javascript
const clock = new THREE.Clock();

function animate() {
  const delta = clock.getDelta(); // Time since last frame (seconds)
  const elapsed = clock.getElapsedTime(); // Total time (seconds)

  mesh.rotation.y += delta * 0.5; // Consistent speed regardless of framerate

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

### Responsive Canvas

```javascript
function onWindowResize() {
  const width = window.innerWidth;
  const height = window.innerHeight;

  camera.aspect = width / height;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();

  renderer.setSize(width, height);
  renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2));
}
window.addEventListener("resize", onWindowResize);
```

### Loading Manager

```javascript
const manager = new THREE.LoadingManager();

manager.onStart = (url, loaded, total) => console.log("Started loading");
manager.onLoad = () => console.log("All loaded");
manager.onProgress = (url, loaded, total) => console.log(`${loaded}/${total}`);
manager.onError = (url) => console.error(`Error loading ${url}`);

const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader(manager);
const gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader(manager);
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Limit draw calls**: Merge geometries, use instancing, atlas textures
2. **Frustum culling**: Enabled by default, ensure bounding boxes are correct
3. **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Use `THREE.LOD` for distance-based mesh switching
4. **Object pooling**: Reuse objects instead of creating/destroying
5. **Avoid `getWorldPosition` in loops**: Cache results

```javascript
// Merge static geometries
import { mergeGeometries } from "three/examples/jsm/utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js";
const merged = mergeGeometries([geo1, geo2, geo3]);

// LOD
const lod = new THREE.LOD();
lod.addLevel(highDetailMesh, 0);
lod.addLevel(medDetailMesh, 50);
lod.addLevel(lowDetailMesh, 100);
scene.add(lod);
```

// Create mesh
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(box, material);
scene.add(mesh);
```

## Built-in Geometries

```javascript
// Box - width, height, depth, widthSegments, heightSegments, depthSegments
new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1);

// Sphere - radius, widthSegments, heightSegments, phiStart, phiLength, thetaStart, thetaLength
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32, 0, Math.PI * 2, 0, Math.PI); // Full sphere
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32, 0, Math.PI); // Hemisphere

// Plane - width, height, widthSegments, heightSegments
new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10, 1, 1);

```javascript
// Capsule - radius, length, capSegments, radialSegments
new THREE.CapsuleGeometry(0.5, 1, 4, 8);

// Dodecahedron - radius, detail
new THREE.DodecahedronGeometry(1, 0);

const indices = [2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 3, 1];
new THREE.PolyhedronGeometry(vertices, indices, 1, 0);
```

### Path-Based Shapes

```javascript
// Lathe - points[], segments, phiStart, phiLength
const points = [
  new THREE.Vector2(0, 0),
  new THREE.Vector2(0.5, 0),
  new THREE.Vector2(0.5, 1),
  new THREE.Vector2(0, 1),
];
new THREE.LatheGeometry(points, 32);

// Extrude - shape, options
const shape = new THREE.Shape();
shape.moveTo(0, 0);
shape.lineTo(1, 0);
shape.lineTo(1, 1);
shape.lineTo(0, 1);
shape.lineTo(0, 0);

const extrudeSettings = {
  steps: 2,

  bevelSegments: 3,
};
new THREE.ExtrudeGeometry(shape, extrudeSettings);

// Tube - path, tubularSegments, radius, radialSegments, closed

  new THREE.Vector3(-1, 0, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0),
]);
new THREE.TubeGeometry(curve, 64, 0.2, 8, false);
```

### Text Geometry

import { FontLoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/FontLoader.js";
import { TextGeometry } from "three/examples/jsm/geometries/TextGeometry.js";

const loader = new FontLoader();
loader.load("fonts/helvetiker_regular.typeface.json", (font) => {
  const geometry = new TextGeometry("Hello", {
    font: font,
    size: 1,
    depth: 0.2, // Was ''height'' in older versions
    curveSegments: 12,
    bevelEnabled: true,
    bevelThickness: 0.03,
    bevelSize: 0.02,
    bevelSegments: 5,
  });

  // Center text
  geometry.computeBoundingBox();
  geometry.center();

  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  scene.add(mesh);
});
```

## BufferGeometry

The base class for all geometries. Stores data as typed arrays for GPU efficiency.

### Custom BufferGeometry

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();

// Vertices (3 floats per vertex: x, y, z)
const vertices = new Float32Array([
  -1,
  -1,
  0, // vertex 0
  1,
  -1,
  0, // vertex 1
  1,
  1,
  0, // vertex 2
  -1,
  1,
  0, // vertex 3
]);
geometry.setAttribute("position", new THREE.BufferAttribute(vertices, 3));

// Indices (for indexed geometry - reuse vertices)
const indices = new Uint16Array([
  0,
  1,
  2, // triangle 1
  0,
  2,
  3, // triangle 2
]);
geometry.setIndex(new THREE.BufferAttribute(indices, 1));

// Normals (required for lighting)
const normals = new Float32Array([0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]);
geometry.setAttribute("normal", new THREE.BufferAttribute(normals, 3));

// UVs (for texturing)
const uvs = new Float32Array([0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]);
geometry.setAttribute("uv", new THREE.BufferAttribute(uvs, 2));

// Colors (per-vertex colors)
const colors = new Float32Array([
  1,
  0,
  0, // red
  0,
  1,
  0, // green
  0,
  0,
  1, // blue
  1,
  1,
  0, // yellow
]);
geometry.setAttribute("color", new THREE.BufferAttribute(colors, 3));
// Use with: material.vertexColors = true
```

### BufferAttribute Types

```javascript
// Common attribute types
new THREE.BufferAttribute(array, itemSize);

// Typed array options
new Float32Array(count * itemSize); // Positions, normals, UVs
new Uint16Array(count); // Indices (up to 65535 vertices)
new Uint32Array(count); // Indices (larger meshes)
new Uint8Array(count * itemSize); // Colors (0-255 range)

// Item sizes
// Position: 3 (x, y, z)
// Normal: 3 (x, y, z)
// UV: 2 (u, v)
// Color: 3 (r, g, b) or 4 (r, g, b, a)
// Index: 1
```

### Modifying BufferGeometry

```javascript
const positions = geometry.attributes.position;

// Modify vertex
positions.setXYZ(index, x, y, z);

// Access vertex
const x = positions.getX(index);
const y = positions.getY(index);
const z = positions.getZ(index);

// Flag for GPU update
positions.needsUpdate = true;

// Recompute normals after position changes
geometry.computeVertexNormals();

// Recompute bounding box/sphere after changes
geometry.computeBoundingBox();
geometry.computeBoundingSphere();
```

### Interleaved Buffers (Advanced)

```javascript
// More efficient memory layout for large meshes
const interleavedBuffer = new THREE.InterleavedBuffer(
  new Float32Array([
    // pos.x, pos.y, pos.z, uv.u, uv.v (repeated per vertex)
    -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, -1, 1, 0, 0, 1,
  ]),
  5, // stride (floats per vertex)
);

geometry.setAttribute(
  "position",
  new THREE.InterleavedBufferAttribute(interleavedBuffer, 3, 0),
); // size 3, offset 0
geometry.setAttribute(
  "uv",
  new THREE.InterleavedBufferAttribute(interleavedBuffer, 2, 3),
); // size 2, offset 3
```

## EdgesGeometry & WireframeGeometry

```javascript
// Edge lines (only hard edges)
const edges = new THREE.EdgesGeometry(boxGeometry, 15); // 15 = threshold angle
const edgeMesh = new THREE.LineSegments(
  edges,
  new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffffff }),
);

// Wireframe (all triangles)
const wireframe = new THREE.WireframeGeometry(boxGeometry);
const wireMesh = new THREE.LineSegments(
  wireframe,
  new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffffff }),
);
```

## Points

```javascript
// Create point cloud
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
const positions = new Float32Array(1000 * 3);

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  positions[i * 3] = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
  positions[i * 3 + 1] = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
  positions[i * 3 + 2] = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 10;
}

geometry.setAttribute("position", new THREE.BufferAttribute(positions, 3));

const material = new THREE.PointsMaterial({
  size: 0.1,
  sizeAttenuation: true, // Size decreases with distance
  color: 0xffffff,
});

const points = new THREE.Points(geometry, material);
scene.add(points);
```

## Lines

```javascript
// Line (connected points)
const points = [
  new THREE.Vector3(-1, 0, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0),
];
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(points);
const line = new THREE.Line(
  geometry,
  new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 }),
);

// LineLoop (closed loop)
const loop = new THREE.LineLoop(geometry, material);

// LineSegments (pairs of points)
const segmentsGeometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
segmentsGeometry.setAttribute(
  "position",
  new THREE.BufferAttribute(
    new Float32Array([
      -1,
      0,
      0,
      0,
      1,
      0, // segment 1
      0,
      1,
      0,
      1,
      0,
      0, // segment 2
    ]),
    3,
  ),
);
const segments = new THREE.LineSegments(segmentsGeometry, material);
```

## InstancedMesh

Efficiently render many copies of the same geometry.

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const count = 1000;

const instancedMesh = new THREE.InstancedMesh(geometry, material, count);

// Set transforms for each instance
const dummy = new THREE.Object3D();
const matrix = new THREE.Matrix4();

for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  dummy.position.set(
    (Math.random() - 0.5) * 20,
    (Math.random() - 0.5) * 20,
    (Math.random() - 0.5) * 20,
  );
  dummy.rotation.set(Math.random() * Math.PI, Math.random() * Math.PI, 0);
  dummy.scale.setScalar(0.5 + Math.random());
  dummy.updateMatrix();

  instancedMesh.setMatrixAt(i, dummy.matrix);
}

// Flag for GPU update
instancedMesh.instanceMatrix.needsUpdate = true;

// Optional: per-instance colors
instancedMesh.instanceColor = new THREE.InstancedBufferAttribute(
  new Float32Array(count * 3),
  3,
);
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  instancedMesh.setColorAt(
    i,
    new THREE.Color(Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random()),
  );
}
instancedMesh.instanceColor.needsUpdate = true;

scene.add(instancedMesh);
```

### Update Instance at Runtime

```javascript
// Update single instance
const matrix = new THREE.Matrix4();
instancedMesh.getMatrixAt(index, matrix);
// Modify matrix...
instancedMesh.setMatrixAt(index, matrix);
instancedMesh.instanceMatrix.needsUpdate = true;

// Raycasting with instanced mesh
const intersects = raycaster.intersectObject(instancedMesh);
if (intersects.length > 0) {
  const instanceId = intersects[0].instanceId;
}
```

## InstancedBufferGeometry (Advanced)

For custom per-instance attributes beyond transform/color.

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.InstancedBufferGeometry();
geometry.copy(new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1));

// Add per-instance attribute
const offsets = new Float32Array(count * 3);
for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
  offsets[i * 3] = Math.random() * 10;
  offsets[i * 3 + 1] = Math.random() * 10;
  offsets[i * 3 + 2] = Math.random() * 10;
}
geometry.setAttribute("offset", new THREE.InstancedBufferAttribute(offsets, 3));

// Use in shader
// attribute vec3 offset;
// vec3 transformed = position + offset;
```

## Geometry Utilities

```javascript
import * as BufferGeometryUtils from "three/examples/jsm/utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js";

// Merge geometries (must have same attributes)
const merged = BufferGeometryUtils.mergeGeometries([geo1, geo2, geo3]);

// Merge with groups (for multi-material)
const merged = BufferGeometryUtils.mergeGeometries([geo1, geo2], true);

// Compute tangents (required for normal maps)
BufferGeometryUtils.computeTangents(geometry);

// Interleave attributes for better performance
const interleaved = BufferGeometryUtils.interleaveAttributes([
  geometry.attributes.position,
  geometry.attributes.normal,
  geometry.attributes.uv,
]);
```

## Common Patterns

### Center Geometry

```javascript
geometry.computeBoundingBox();
geometry.center(); // Move vertices so center is at origin
```

### Scale to Fit

```javascript
geometry.computeBoundingBox();
const size = new THREE.Vector3();
geometry.boundingBox.getSize(size);
const maxDim = Math.max(size.x, size.y, size.z);
geometry.scale(1 / maxDim, 1 / maxDim, 1 / maxDim);
```

### Clone and Transform

```javascript
const clone = geometry.clone();
clone.rotateX(Math.PI / 2);
clone.translate(0, 1, 0);
clone.scale(2, 2, 2);
```

### Morph Targets

```javascript
// Base geometry
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4);

// Create morph target
const morphPositions = geometry.attributes.position.array.slice();
for (let i = 0; i < morphPositions.length; i += 3) {
  morphPositions[i] *= 2; // Scale X
  morphPositions[i + 1] *= 0.5; // Squash Y
}

geometry.morphAttributes.position = [
  new THREE.BufferAttribute(new Float32Array(morphPositions), 3),
];

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
mesh.morphTargetInfluences[0] = 0.5; // 50% blend
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use indexed geometry**: Reuse vertices with indices
2. **Merge static meshes**: Reduce draw calls with `mergeGeometries`
3. **Use InstancedMesh**: For many identical objects
4. **Choose appropriate segment counts**: More segments = smoother but slower
5. **Dispose unused geometry**: `geometry.dispose()`

```javascript
// Good segment counts for common uses
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32); // Good quality
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 64, 64); // High quality
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 16, 16); // Performance mode

// Dispose when done
geometry.dispose();
```

# Three.js Interaction

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js";

// Camera controls
const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
controls.enableDamping = true;

// Raycasting for click detection
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
const mouse = new THREE.Vector2();

function onClick(event) {
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    console.log("Clicked:", intersects[0].object);
  }
}

window.addEventListener("click", onClick);
```

## Raycaster

### Basic Raycasting

```javascript
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();

// From camera (mouse picking)
raycaster.setFromCamera(mousePosition, camera);

// From any origin and direction
raycaster.set(origin, direction); // origin: Vector3, direction: normalized Vector3

// Get intersections
const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(objects, recursive);

// intersects array contains:
// {
//   distance: number,          // Distance from ray origin
//   point: Vector3,            // Intersection point in world coords
//   face: Face3,               // Intersected face
//   faceIndex: number,         // Face index
//   object: Object3D,          // Intersected object
//   uv: Vector2,               // UV coordinates at intersection
//   uv1: Vector2,              // Second UV channel
//   normal: Vector3,           // Interpolated face normal
//   instanceId: number         // For InstancedMesh
// }
```

### Mouse Position Conversion

```javascript
const mouse = new THREE.Vector2();

function updateMouse(event) {
  // For full window
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
}

// For specific canvas element
function updateMouseCanvas(event, canvas) {
  const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  mouse.x = ((event.clientX - rect.left) / rect.width) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -((event.clientY - rect.top) / rect.height) * 2 + 1;
}
```

### Touch Support

```javascript
function onTouchStart(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  if (event.touches.length === 1) {
    const touch = event.touches[0];
    mouse.x = (touch.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(touch.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(clickableObjects);

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      handleSelection(intersects[0]);
    }
  }
}

renderer.domElement.addEventListener("touchstart", onTouchStart);
```

### Raycaster Options

```javascript
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();

// Near/far clipping (default: 0, Infinity)
raycaster.near = 0;
raycaster.far = 100;

// Line/Points precision
raycaster.params.Line.threshold = 0.1;
raycaster.params.Points.threshold = 0.1;

// Layers (only intersect objects on specific layers)
raycaster.layers.set(1);
```

### Efficient Raycasting

```javascript
// Only check specific objects
const clickables = [mesh1, mesh2, mesh3];
const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(clickables, false);

// Use layers for filtering
mesh1.layers.set(1); // Clickable layer
raycaster.layers.set(1);

// Throttle raycast for hover effects
let lastRaycast = 0;
function onMouseMove(event) {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - lastRaycast < 50) return; // 20fps max
  lastRaycast = now;

  // Raycast here
}
```

## Camera Controls

      break;
  }
});

function animate() {
  if (controls.isLocked) {
    direction.z = Number(moveForward) - Number(moveBackward);
    direction.normalize();

controls.maxPolarAngle = Math.PI / 2;
```

## TransformControls

Gizmo for moving/rotating/scaling objects.

```javascript
import { TransformControls } from "three/addons/controls/TransformControls.js";

const transformControls = new TransformControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
scene.add(transformControls);

// Attach to object
transformControls.attach(selectedMesh);

// Switch modes
transformControls.setMode("translate"); // ''translate'', ''rotate'', ''scale''

// Change space
transformControls.setSpace("local"); // ''local'', ''world''

// Size
transformControls.setSize(1);

// Events
transformControls.addEventListener("dragging-changed", (event) => {
  // Disable orbit controls while dragging
  orbitControls.enabled = !event.value;
});

transformControls.addEventListener("change", () => {
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});

// Keyboard shortcuts
window.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  switch (event.key) {
    case "g":
      transformControls.setMode("translate");
      break;
    case "r":
      transformControls.setMode("rotate");
      break;
    case "s":
      transformControls.setMode("scale");
      break;
    case "Escape":
      transformControls.detach();
      break;
  }
});
```

## DragControls

Drag objects directly.

```javascript
import { DragControls } from "three/addons/controls/DragControls.js";

const draggableObjects = [mesh1, mesh2, mesh3];
const dragControls = new DragControls(
  draggableObjects,
  camera,
  renderer.domElement,
);

dragControls.addEventListener("dragstart", (event) => {
  orbitControls.enabled = false;
  event.object.material.emissive.set(0xaaaaaa);
});

dragControls.addEventListener("drag", (event) => {
  // Constrain to ground plane
  event.object.position.y = 0;
});

dragControls.addEventListener("dragend", (event) => {
  orbitControls.enabled = true;
  event.object.material.emissive.set(0x000000);
});
```

## Selection System

### Click to Select

```javascript
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
const mouse = new THREE.Vector2();
let selectedObject = null;

function onMouseDown(event) {
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(selectableObjects);

  // Deselect previous
  if (selectedObject) {
    selectedObject.material.emissive.set(0x000000);
  }

  // Select new
  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    selectedObject = intersects[0].object;
    selectedObject.material.emissive.set(0x444444);
  } else {
    selectedObject = null;
  }
}
```

### Box Selection

```javascript
import { SelectionBox } from "three/addons/interactive/SelectionBox.js";
import { SelectionHelper } from "three/addons/interactive/SelectionHelper.js";

const selectionBox = new SelectionBox(camera, scene);
const selectionHelper = new SelectionHelper(renderer, "selectBox"); // CSS class

document.addEventListener("pointerdown", (event) => {
  selectionBox.startPoint.set(
    (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1,
    -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1,
    0.5,
  );
});

document.addEventListener("pointermove", (event) => {
  if (selectionHelper.isDown) {
    selectionBox.endPoint.set(
      (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1,
      -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1,
      0.5,
    );
  }
});

document.addEventListener("pointerup", (event) => {
  selectionBox.endPoint.set(
    (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1,
    -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1,
    0.5,
  );

  const selected = selectionBox.select();
  console.log("Selected objects:", selected);
});
```

### Hover Effects

```javascript
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
const mouse = new THREE.Vector2();
let hoveredObject = null;

function onMouseMove(event) {
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(hoverableObjects);

  // Reset previous hover
  if (hoveredObject) {
    hoveredObject.material.color.set(hoveredObject.userData.originalColor);
    document.body.style.cursor = "default";
  }

  // Apply new hover
  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    hoveredObject = intersects[0].object;
    if (!hoveredObject.userData.originalColor) {
      hoveredObject.userData.originalColor =
        hoveredObject.material.color.getHex();
    }
    hoveredObject.material.color.set(0xff6600);
    document.body.style.cursor = "pointer";
  } else {
    hoveredObject = null;
  }
}

window.addEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove);
```

## Keyboard Input

```javascript
const keys = {};

document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  keys[event.code] = true;
});

document.addEventListener("keyup", (event) => {
  keys[event.code] = false;
});

function update() {
  const speed = 0.1;

  if (keys["KeyW"]) player.position.z -= speed;
  if (keys["KeyS"]) player.position.z += speed;
  if (keys["KeyA"]) player.position.x -= speed;
  if (keys["KeyD"]) player.position.x += speed;
  if (keys["Space"]) player.position.y += speed;
  if (keys["ShiftLeft"]) player.position.y -= speed;
}
```

## World-Screen Coordinate Conversion

### World to Screen

```javascript
function worldToScreen(position, camera) {
  const vector = position.clone();
  vector.project(camera);

  return {
    x: ((vector.x + 1) / 2) * window.innerWidth,
    y: (-(vector.y - 1) / 2) * window.innerHeight,
  };
}

// Position HTML element over 3D object
const screenPos = worldToScreen(mesh.position, camera);
element.style.left = screenPos.x + "px";
element.style.top = screenPos.y + "px";
```

### Screen to World

```javascript
function screenToWorld(screenX, screenY, camera, targetZ = 0) {
  const vector = new THREE.Vector3(
    (screenX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1,
    -(screenY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1,
    0.5,
  );

  vector.unproject(camera);

  const dir = vector.sub(camera.position).normalize();
  const distance = (targetZ - camera.position.z) / dir.z;

  return camera.position.clone().add(dir.multiplyScalar(distance));
}
```

### Ray-Plane Intersection

```javascript
function getRayPlaneIntersection(mouse, camera, plane) {
  const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

  const intersection = new THREE.Vector3();
  raycaster.ray.intersectPlane(plane, intersection);

  return intersection;
}

// Ground plane
const groundPlane = new THREE.Plane(new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0), 0);
const worldPos = getRayPlaneIntersection(mouse, camera, groundPlane);
```

## Event Handling Best Practices

```javascript
class InteractionManager {
  constructor(camera, renderer, scene) {
    this.camera = camera;
    this.renderer = renderer;
    this.scene = scene;
    this.raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
    this.mouse = new THREE.Vector2();
    this.clickables = [];

    this.bindEvents();
  }

  bindEvents() {
    const canvas = this.renderer.domElement;

    canvas.addEventListener("click", (e) => this.onClick(e));
    canvas.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => this.onMouseMove(e));
    canvas.addEventListener("touchstart", (e) => this.onTouchStart(e));
  }

  updateMouse(event) {
    const rect = this.renderer.domElement.getBoundingClientRect();
    this.mouse.x = ((event.clientX - rect.left) / rect.width) * 2 - 1;
    this.mouse.y = -((event.clientY - rect.top) / rect.height) * 2 + 1;
  }

  getIntersects() {
    this.raycaster.setFromCamera(this.mouse, this.camera);
    return this.raycaster.intersectObjects(this.clickables, true);
  }

  onClick(event) {
    this.updateMouse(event);
    const intersects = this.getIntersects();

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      const object = intersects[0].object;
      if (object.userData.onClick) {
        object.userData.onClick(intersects[0]);
      }
    }
  }

  addClickable(object, callback) {
    this.clickables.push(object);
    object.userData.onClick = callback;
  }

  dispose() {
    // Remove event listeners
  }
}

// Usage
const interaction = new InteractionManager(camera, renderer, scene);
interaction.addClickable(mesh, (intersect) => {
  console.log("Clicked at:", intersect.point);
});
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Limit raycasts**: Throttle mousemove handlers
2. **Use layers**: Filter raycast targets
3. **Simple collision meshes**: Use invisible simpler geometry for raycasting
4. **Disable controls when not needed**: `controls.enabled = false`
5. **Batch updates**: Group interaction checks

```javascript
// Use simpler geometry for raycasting
const complexMesh = loadedModel;
const collisionMesh = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ visible: false }),
);
collisionMesh.userData.target = complexMesh;
clickables.push(collisionMesh);
```

# Three.js Lighting

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

// Basic lighting setup
const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.5);
scene.add(ambientLight);

const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);
directionalLight.position.set(5, 5, 5);
scene.add(directionalLight);
```

## Light Types Overview

| Light            | Description            | Shadow Support | Cost     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| AmbientLight     | Uniform everywhere     | No             | Very Low |
| HemisphereLight  | Sky/ground gradient    | No             | Very Low |
| DirectionalLight | Parallel rays (sun)    | Yes            | Low      |
| PointLight       | Omnidirectional (bulb) | Yes            | Medium   |
| SpotLight        | Cone-shaped            | Yes            | Medium   |
| RectAreaLight    | Area light (window)    | No\*           | High     |

\*RectAreaLight shadows require custom solutions

## AmbientLight

Illuminates all objects equally. No direction, no shadows.

```javascript
// AmbientLight(color, intensity)
const ambient = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.5);
scene.add(ambient);

// Modify at runtime
ambient.color.set(0xffffcc);
ambient.intensity = 0.3;
```

## HemisphereLight

Gradient from sky to ground color. Good for outdoor scenes.

```javascript
// HemisphereLight(skyColor, groundColor, intensity)
const hemi = new THREE.HemisphereLight(0x87ceeb, 0x8b4513, 0.6);
hemi.position.set(0, 50, 0);
scene.add(hemi);

// Properties
hemi.color; // Sky color
hemi.groundColor; // Ground color
hemi.intensity;
```

## DirectionalLight

Parallel light rays. Simulates distant light source (sun).

```javascript
// DirectionalLight(color, intensity)
const dirLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);
dirLight.position.set(5, 10, 5);

// Light points at target (default: 0, 0, 0)
dirLight.target.position.set(0, 0, 0);
scene.add(dirLight.target);

scene.add(dirLight);
```

### DirectionalLight Shadows

```javascript
dirLight.castShadow = true;

// Shadow map size (higher = sharper, more expensive)
dirLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 2048;
dirLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 2048;

// Shadow camera (orthographic)
dirLight.shadow.camera.near = 0.5;
dirLight.shadow.camera.far = 50;
dirLight.shadow.camera.left = -10;
dirLight.shadow.camera.right = 10;
dirLight.shadow.camera.top = 10;
dirLight.shadow.camera.bottom = -10;

// Shadow softness
dirLight.shadow.radius = 4; // Blur radius (PCFSoftShadowMap only)

// Shadow bias (fixes shadow acne)
dirLight.shadow.bias = -0.0001;
dirLight.shadow.normalBias = 0.02;

// Helper to visualize shadow camera
const helper = new THREE.CameraHelper(dirLight.shadow.camera);
scene.add(helper);
```

## PointLight

Emits light in all directions from a point. Like a light bulb.

```javascript
// PointLight(color, intensity, distance, decay)
const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 100, 2);
pointLight.position.set(0, 5, 0);
scene.add(pointLight);

// Properties
pointLight.distance; // Maximum range (0 = infinite)
pointLight.decay; // Light falloff (physically correct = 2)
```

### PointLight Shadows

```javascript
pointLight.castShadow = true;
pointLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024;
pointLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;

// Shadow camera (perspective - 6 directions for cube map)
pointLight.shadow.camera.near = 0.5;
pointLight.shadow.camera.far = 50;

pointLight.shadow.bias = -0.005;
```

## SpotLight

Cone-shaped light. Like a flashlight or stage light.

```javascript
// SpotLight(color, intensity, distance, angle, penumbra, decay)
const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight(0xffffff, 1, 100, Math.PI / 6, 0.5, 2);
spotLight.position.set(0, 10, 0);

// Target (light points at this)
spotLight.target.position.set(0, 0, 0);
scene.add(spotLight.target);

scene.add(spotLight);

// Properties
spotLight.angle; // Cone angle (radians, max Math.PI/2)
spotLight.penumbra; // Soft edge (0-1)
spotLight.distance; // Range
spotLight.decay; // Falloff
```

### SpotLight Shadows

```javascript
spotLight.castShadow = true;
spotLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024;
spotLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;

// Shadow camera (perspective)
spotLight.shadow.camera.near = 0.5;
spotLight.shadow.camera.far = 50;
spotLight.shadow.camera.fov = 30;

spotLight.shadow.bias = -0.0001;

// Focus (affects shadow projection)
spotLight.shadow.focus = 1;
```

## RectAreaLight

Rectangular area light. Great for soft, realistic lighting.

```javascript
import { RectAreaLightHelper } from "three/examples/jsm/helpers/RectAreaLightHelper.js";
import { RectAreaLightUniformsLib } from "three/examples/jsm/lights/RectAreaLightUniformsLib.js";

// Must initialize uniforms first
RectAreaLightUniformsLib.init();

// RectAreaLight(color, intensity, width, height)
const rectLight = new THREE.RectAreaLight(0xffffff, 5, 4, 2);
rectLight.position.set(0, 5, 0);
rectLight.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
scene.add(rectLight);

// Helper
const helper = new RectAreaLightHelper(rectLight);
rectLight.add(helper);

// Note: Only works with MeshStandardMaterial and MeshPhysicalMaterial
// Does not cast shadows natively
```

## Shadow Setup

### Enable Shadows

```javascript
// 1. Enable on renderer
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;
renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap;

// Shadow map types:
// THREE.BasicShadowMap - fastest, low quality
// THREE.PCFShadowMap - default, filtered
// THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap - softer edges
// THREE.VSMShadowMap - variance shadow map

// 2. Enable on light
light.castShadow = true;

// 3. Enable on objects
mesh.castShadow = true;
mesh.receiveShadow = true;

// Ground plane
floor.receiveShadow = true;
floor.castShadow = false; // Usually false for floors
```

### Optimizing Shadows

```javascript
// Tight shadow camera frustum
const d = 10;
dirLight.shadow.camera.left = -d;
dirLight.shadow.camera.right = d;
dirLight.shadow.camera.top = d;
dirLight.shadow.camera.bottom = -d;
dirLight.shadow.camera.near = 0.5;
dirLight.shadow.camera.far = 30;

// Fix shadow acne
dirLight.shadow.bias = -0.0001; // Depth bias
dirLight.shadow.normalBias = 0.02; // Bias along normal

// Shadow map size (balance quality vs performance)
// 512 - low quality
// 1024 - medium quality
// 2048 - high quality
// 4096 - very high quality (expensive)
```

### Contact Shadows (Fake, Fast)

```javascript
import { ContactShadows } from "three/examples/jsm/objects/ContactShadows.js";

const contactShadows = new ContactShadows({
  resolution: 512,
  blur: 2,
  opacity: 0.5,
  scale: 10,
  position: [0, 0, 0],
});
scene.add(contactShadows);
```

## Light Helpers

```javascript
import { RectAreaLightHelper } from "three/examples/jsm/helpers/RectAreaLightHelper.js";

// DirectionalLight helper
const dirHelper = new THREE.DirectionalLightHelper(dirLight, 5);
scene.add(dirHelper);

// PointLight helper
const pointHelper = new THREE.PointLightHelper(pointLight, 1);
scene.add(pointHelper);

// SpotLight helper
const spotHelper = new THREE.SpotLightHelper(spotLight);
scene.add(spotHelper);

// Hemisphere helper
const hemiHelper = new THREE.HemisphereLightHelper(hemiLight, 5);
scene.add(hemiHelper);

// RectAreaLight helper
const rectHelper = new RectAreaLightHelper(rectLight);
rectLight.add(rectHelper);

// Update helpers when light changes
dirHelper.update();
spotHelper.update();
```

## Environment Lighting (IBL)

Image-Based Lighting using HDR environment maps.

```javascript
import { RGBELoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/RGBELoader.js";

const rgbeLoader = new RGBELoader();
rgbeLoader.load("environment.hdr", (texture) => {
  texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;

  // Set as scene environment (affects all PBR materials)
  scene.environment = texture;

  // Optional: also use as background
  scene.background = texture;
  scene.backgroundBlurriness = 0; // 0-1, blur the background
  scene.backgroundIntensity = 1;
});

// PMREMGenerator for better reflections
const pmremGenerator = new THREE.PMREMGenerator(renderer);
pmremGenerator.compileEquirectangularShader();

rgbeLoader.load("environment.hdr", (texture) => {
  const envMap = pmremGenerator.fromEquirectangular(texture).texture;
  scene.environment = envMap;
  texture.dispose();
  pmremGenerator.dispose();
});
```

### Cube Texture Environment

```javascript
const cubeLoader = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader();
const envMap = cubeLoader.load([
  "px.jpg",
  "nx.jpg",
  "py.jpg",
  "ny.jpg",
  "pz.jpg",
  "nz.jpg",
]);

scene.environment = envMap;
scene.background = envMap;
```

## Light Probes (Advanced)

Capture lighting from a point in space for ambient lighting.

```javascript
import { LightProbeGenerator } from "three/examples/jsm/lights/LightProbeGenerator.js";

// Generate from cube texture
const lightProbe = new THREE.LightProbe();
scene.add(lightProbe);

lightProbe.copy(LightProbeGenerator.fromCubeTexture(cubeTexture));

// Or from render target
const cubeCamera = new THREE.CubeCamera(
  0.1,
  100,
  new THREE.WebGLCubeRenderTarget(256),
);
cubeCamera.update(renderer, scene);
lightProbe.copy(
  LightProbeGenerator.fromCubeRenderTarget(renderer, cubeCamera.renderTarget),
);
```

## Common Lighting Setups

### Three-Point Lighting

```javascript
// Key light (main light)
const keyLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);
keyLight.position.set(5, 5, 5);
scene.add(keyLight);

// Fill light (softer, opposite side)
const fillLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.5);
fillLight.position.set(-5, 3, 5);
scene.add(fillLight);

// Back light (rim lighting)
const backLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.3);
backLight.position.set(0, 5, -5);
scene.add(backLight);

// Ambient fill
const ambient = new THREE.AmbientLight(0x404040, 0.3);
scene.add(ambient);
```

### Outdoor Daylight

```javascript
// Sun
const sun = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffcc, 1.5);
sun.position.set(50, 100, 50);
sun.castShadow = true;
scene.add(sun);

// Sky ambient
const hemi = new THREE.HemisphereLight(0x87ceeb, 0x8b4513, 0.6);
scene.add(hemi);
```

### Indoor Studio

```javascript
// Multiple area lights
RectAreaLightUniformsLib.init();

const light1 = new THREE.RectAreaLight(0xffffff, 5, 2, 2);
light1.position.set(3, 3, 3);
light1.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
scene.add(light1);

const light2 = new THREE.RectAreaLight(0xffffff, 3, 2, 2);
light2.position.set(-3, 3, 3);
light2.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
scene.add(light2);

// Ambient fill
const ambient = new THREE.AmbientLight(0x404040, 0.2);
scene.add(ambient);
```

## Light Animation

```javascript
const clock = new THREE.Clock();

function animate() {
  const time = clock.getElapsedTime();

  // Orbit light around scene
  light.position.x = Math.cos(time) * 5;
  light.position.z = Math.sin(time) * 5;

  // Pulsing intensity
  light.intensity = 1 + Math.sin(time * 2) * 0.5;

  // Color cycling
  light.color.setHSL((time * 0.1) % 1, 1, 0.5);

  // Update helpers if using
  lightHelper.update();
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Limit light count**: Each light adds shader complexity
2. **Use baked lighting**: For static scenes, bake to textures
3. **Smaller shadow maps**: 512-1024 often sufficient
4. **Tight shadow frustums**: Only cover needed area
5. **Disable unused shadows**: Not all lights need shadows
6. **Use light layers**: Exclude objects from certain lights

```javascript
// Light layers
light.layers.set(1); // Light only affects layer 1
mesh.layers.enable(1); // Mesh is on layer 1
otherMesh.layers.disable(1); // Other mesh not affected

// Selective shadows
mesh.castShadow = true;
mesh.receiveShadow = true;
decorMesh.castShadow = false; // Small objects often don''t need to cast
```

# Three.js Loaders

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";

// Load GLTF model
const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load("model.glb", (gltf) => {
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
});

// Load texture
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = textureLoader.load("texture.jpg");
```

## LoadingManager

Coordinate multiple loaders and track progress.

```javascript
const manager = new THREE.LoadingManager();

// Callbacks
manager.onStart = (url, loaded, total) => {
  console.log(`Started loading: ${url}`);
};

manager.onLoad = () => {
  console.log("All assets loaded!");
  startGame();
};

manager.onProgress = (url, loaded, total) => {
  const progress = (loaded / total) * 100;
  console.log(`Loading: ${progress.toFixed(1)}%`);
  updateProgressBar(progress);
};

manager.onError = (url) => {
  console.error(`Error loading: ${url}`);
};

// Use manager with loaders
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader(manager);
const gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader(manager);

// Load assets
textureLoader.load("texture1.jpg");
textureLoader.load("texture2.jpg");
gltfLoader.load("model.glb");
// onLoad fires when ALL are complete
```

## Texture Loading

### TextureLoader

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

// Callback style
loader.load(
  "texture.jpg",
  (texture) => {
    // onLoad
    material.map = texture;
    material.needsUpdate = true;
  },
  undefined, // onProgress - not supported for image loading
  (error) => {
    // onError
    console.error("Error loading texture", error);
  },
);

// Synchronous (returns texture, loads async)
const texture = loader.load("texture.jpg");
material.map = texture;
```

### Texture Configuration

```javascript
const texture = loader.load("texture.jpg", (tex) => {
  // Color space (important for color accuracy)
  tex.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace; // For color/albedo maps
  // tex.colorSpace = THREE.LinearSRGBColorSpace;  // For data maps (normal, roughness)

  // Wrapping
  tex.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
  tex.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
  // ClampToEdgeWrapping, RepeatWrapping, MirroredRepeatWrapping

  // Repeat/offset
  tex.repeat.set(2, 2);
  tex.offset.set(0.5, 0.5);
  tex.rotation = Math.PI / 4;
  tex.center.set(0.5, 0.5);

  // Filtering
  tex.minFilter = THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter; // Default
  tex.magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter; // Default
  // NearestFilter - pixelated
  // LinearFilter - smooth
  // LinearMipmapLinearFilter - smooth with mipmaps

  // Anisotropic filtering (sharper at angles)
  tex.anisotropy = renderer.capabilities.getMaxAnisotropy();

  // Flip Y (usually true for standard textures)
  tex.flipY = true;

  tex.needsUpdate = true;
});
```

### CubeTextureLoader

For environment maps and skyboxes.

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader();

// Load 6 faces
const cubeTexture = loader.load([
  "px.jpg",
  "nx.jpg", // positive/negative X
  "py.jpg",
  "ny.jpg", // positive/negative Y
  "pz.jpg",
  "nz.jpg", // positive/negative Z
]);

// Use as background
scene.background = cubeTexture;

// Use as environment map
scene.environment = cubeTexture;
material.envMap = cubeTexture;
```

### HDR/EXR Loading

```javascript
import { RGBELoader } from "three/addons/loaders/RGBELoader.js";
import { EXRLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/EXRLoader.js";

// HDR
const rgbeLoader = new RGBELoader();
rgbeLoader.load("environment.hdr", (texture) => {
  texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
  scene.environment = texture;
  scene.background = texture;
});

// EXR
const exrLoader = new EXRLoader();
exrLoader.load("environment.exr", (texture) => {
  texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
  scene.environment = texture;
});
```

### PMREMGenerator

Generate prefiltered environment maps for PBR.

```javascript
import { RGBELoader } from "three/addons/loaders/RGBELoader.js";

const pmremGenerator = new THREE.PMREMGenerator(renderer);
pmremGenerator.compileEquirectangularShader();

new RGBELoader().load("environment.hdr", (texture) => {
  const envMap = pmremGenerator.fromEquirectangular(texture).texture;

  scene.environment = envMap;
  scene.background = envMap;

  texture.dispose();
  pmremGenerator.dispose();
});
```

## GLTF/GLB Loading

The most common 3D format for web.

```javascript
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";

const loader = new GLTFLoader();

loader.load("model.glb", (gltf) => {
  // The loaded scene
  const model = gltf.scene;
  scene.add(model);

  // Animations
  const animations = gltf.animations;
  if (animations.length > 0) {
    const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(model);
    animations.forEach((clip) => {
      mixer.clipAction(clip).play();
    });
  }

  // Cameras (if any)
  const cameras = gltf.cameras;

  // Asset info
  console.log(gltf.asset); // Version, generator, etc.

  // User data from Blender/etc
  console.log(gltf.userData);
});
```

### GLTF with Draco Compression

```javascript
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";
import { DRACOLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/DRACOLoader.js";

const dracoLoader = new DRACOLoader();
dracoLoader.setDecoderPath(
  "https://www.gstatic.com/draco/versioned/decoders/1.5.6/",
);
dracoLoader.preload();

const gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader();
gltfLoader.setDRACOLoader(dracoLoader);

gltfLoader.load("compressed-model.glb", (gltf) => {
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
});
```

### GLTF with KTX2 Textures

```javascript
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";
import { KTX2Loader } from "three/addons/loaders/KTX2Loader.js";

const ktx2Loader = new KTX2Loader();
ktx2Loader.setTranscoderPath(
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/libs/basis/",
);
ktx2Loader.detectSupport(renderer);

const gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader();
gltfLoader.setKTX2Loader(ktx2Loader);

gltfLoader.load("model-with-ktx2.glb", (gltf) => {
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
});
```

### Process GLTF Content

```javascript
loader.load("model.glb", (gltf) => {
  const model = gltf.scene;

  // Enable shadows
  model.traverse((child) => {
    if (child.isMesh) {
      child.castShadow = true;
      child.receiveShadow = true;
    }
  });

  // Find specific mesh
  const head = model.getObjectByName("Head");

  // Adjust materials
  model.traverse((child) => {
    if (child.isMesh && child.material) {
      child.material.envMapIntensity = 0.5;
    }
  });

  // Center and scale
  const box = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(model);
  const center = box.getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());
  const size = box.getSize(new THREE.Vector3());

  model.position.sub(center);

```

### FBX

```javascript
import { FBXLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/FBXLoader.js";

const loader = new FBXLoader();
loader.load("model.fbx", (object) => {
  // FBX often has large scale
  object.scale.setScalar(0.01);

  // Animations

  object.animations.forEach((clip) => {
    mixer.clipAction(clip).play();
  });

  scene.add(object);
});
```

  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  scene.add(mesh);
});
```

## Async/Promise Loading

### Promisified Loader

```javascript
function loadModel(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    loader.load(url, resolve, undefined, reject);
  });
}

// Usage
async function init() {
  try {
    const gltf = await loadModel("model.glb");
    scene.add(gltf.scene);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to load model:", error);
  }
}
```

### Load Multiple Assets

```javascript
async function loadAssets() {
  const [modelGltf, envTexture, colorTexture] = await Promise.all([
    loadGLTF("model.glb"),
    loadRGBE("environment.hdr"),
    loadTexture("color.jpg"),
  ]);

  scene.add(modelGltf.scene);
  scene.environment = envTexture;
  material.map = colorTexture;
}

// Helper functions
function loadGLTF(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    new GLTFLoader().load(url, resolve, undefined, reject);
  });
}

function loadRGBE(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    new RGBELoader().load(
      url,
      (texture) => {
        texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
        resolve(texture);
      },
      undefined,
      reject,
    );
  });
}

function loadTexture(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    new THREE.TextureLoader().load(url, resolve, undefined, reject);
  });
}
```

## Caching

### Built-in Cache

```javascript
// Enable cache
THREE.Cache.enabled = true;

// Clear cache
THREE.Cache.clear();

// Manual cache management
THREE.Cache.add("key", data);
THREE.Cache.get("key");
THREE.Cache.remove("key");
```

### Custom Asset Manager

```javascript
class AssetManager {
  constructor() {
    this.textures = new Map();
    this.models = new Map();
    this.gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader();
    this.textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
  }

  async loadTexture(key, url) {
    if (this.textures.has(key)) {
      return this.textures.get(key);
    }

    const texture = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.textureLoader.load(url, resolve, undefined, reject);
    });

    this.textures.set(key, texture);
    return texture;
  }

  async loadModel(key, url) {
    if (this.models.has(key)) {
      return this.models.get(key).clone();
    }

    const gltf = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.gltfLoader.load(url, resolve, undefined, reject);
    });

    this.models.set(key, gltf.scene);
    return gltf.scene.clone();
  }

  dispose() {
    this.textures.forEach((t) => t.dispose());
    this.textures.clear();
    this.models.clear();
  }
}

// Usage
const assets = new AssetManager();
const texture = await assets.loadTexture("brick", "brick.jpg");
const model = await assets.loadModel("tree", "tree.glb");
```

## Loading from Different Sources

### Data URL / Base64

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = loader.load("data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...");
```

### Blob URL

```javascript
async function loadFromBlob(blob) {
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const texture = await loadTexture(url);
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
  return texture;
}
```

### ArrayBuffer

```javascript
// From fetch
const response = await fetch("model.glb");
const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();

// Parse with loader
const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.parse(buffer, "", (gltf) => {
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
});
```

### Custom Path/URL

```javascript
// Set base path
loader.setPath("assets/models/");
loader.load("model.glb"); // Loads from assets/models/model.glb

// Set resource path (for textures referenced in model)
loader.setResourcePath("assets/textures/");

// Custom URL modifier
manager.setURLModifier((url) => {
  return `https://cdn.example.com/${url}`;
});
```

## Error Handling

```javascript
// Graceful fallback
async function loadWithFallback(primaryUrl, fallbackUrl) {
  try {
    return await loadModel(primaryUrl);
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn(`Primary failed, trying fallback: ${error}`);
    return await loadModel(fallbackUrl);
  }
}

// Retry logic
async function loadWithRetry(url, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await loadModel(url);
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1000 * (i + 1)));
    }
  }
}

// Timeout
async function loadWithTimeout(url, timeout = 30000) {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeout);

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === "AbortError") {
      throw new Error("Loading timed out");
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use compressed formats**: DRACO for geometry, KTX2/Basis for textures
2. **Load progressively**: Show placeholders while loading
3. **Lazy load**: Only load what''s needed
4. **Use CDN**: Faster asset delivery
5. **Enable cache**: `THREE.Cache.enabled = true`

```javascript
// Progressive loading with placeholder
const placeholder = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ wireframe: true }),
);
scene.add(placeholder);

loadModel("model.glb").then((gltf) => {
  scene.remove(placeholder);
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
});
```

## MeshBasicMaterial

No lighting calculations. Fast, always visible.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  color: 0xff0000,
  transparent: true,
  opacity: 0.5,
  side: THREE.DoubleSide, // FrontSide, BackSide, DoubleSide
  wireframe: false,
  map: texture, // Color/diffuse texture
  alphaMap: alphaTexture, // Transparency texture
  envMap: envTexture, // Reflection texture
  reflectivity: 1, // Env map intensity
  fog: true, // Affected by scene fog
});
```

## MeshLambertMaterial

Diffuse-only lighting. Fast, no specular highlights.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({
  color: 0x00ff00,
  emissive: 0x111111, // Self-illumination color
  emissiveIntensity: 1,
  map: texture,
  emissiveMap: emissiveTexture,
  envMap: envTexture,
  reflectivity: 0.5,
});
```

## MeshPhongMaterial

Specular highlights. Good for shiny, plastic-like surfaces.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({
  color: 0x0000ff,
  specular: 0xffffff, // Highlight color
  shininess: 100, // Highlight sharpness (0-1000)
  emissive: 0x000000,
  flatShading: false, // Flat vs smooth shading
  map: texture,
  specularMap: specTexture, // Per-pixel shininess
  normalMap: normalTexture,
  normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(1, 1),
  bumpMap: bumpTexture,
  bumpScale: 1,
  displacementMap: dispTexture,
  displacementScale: 1,
});
```

## MeshStandardMaterial (PBR)

Physically-based rendering. Recommended for realistic results.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0xffffff,
  roughness: 0.5, // 0 = mirror, 1 = diffuse
  metalness: 0.0, // 0 = dielectric, 1 = metal

  // Textures
  map: colorTexture, // Albedo/base color
  roughnessMap: roughTexture, // Per-pixel roughness
  metalnessMap: metalTexture, // Per-pixel metalness
  normalMap: normalTexture, // Surface detail
  normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(1, 1),
  aoMap: aoTexture, // Ambient occlusion (uses uv2!)
  aoMapIntensity: 1,
  displacementMap: dispTexture, // Vertex displacement
  displacementScale: 0.1,
  displacementBias: 0,

  // Emissive
  emissive: 0x000000,
  emissiveIntensity: 1,
  emissiveMap: emissiveTexture,

  // Environment
  envMap: envTexture,
  envMapIntensity: 1,

  // Other
  flatShading: false,
  wireframe: false,
  fog: true,
});

// Note: aoMap requires second UV channel
geometry.setAttribute("uv2", geometry.attributes.uv);
```

## MeshPhysicalMaterial (Advanced PBR)

Extends MeshStandardMaterial with advanced features.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
  // All MeshStandardMaterial properties plus:

  // Clearcoat (car paint, lacquer)
  clearcoat: 1.0, // 0-1 clearcoat layer strength
  clearcoatRoughness: 0.1,
  clearcoatMap: ccTexture,
  clearcoatRoughnessMap: ccrTexture,
  clearcoatNormalMap: ccnTexture,
  clearcoatNormalScale: new THREE.Vector2(1, 1),

  // Transmission (glass, water)
  transmission: 1.0, // 0 = opaque, 1 = fully transparent
  transmissionMap: transTexture,
  thickness: 0.5, // Volume thickness for refraction
  thicknessMap: thickTexture,
  attenuationDistance: 1, // Absorption distance
  attenuationColor: new THREE.Color(0xffffff),

  // Refraction
  ior: 1.5, // Index of refraction (1-2.333)

  // Sheen (fabric, velvet)
  sheen: 1.0,
  sheenRoughness: 0.5,
  sheenColor: new THREE.Color(0xffffff),
  sheenColorMap: sheenTexture,
  sheenRoughnessMap: sheenRoughTexture,

  // Iridescence (soap bubbles, oil slicks)
  iridescence: 1.0,
  iridescenceIOR: 1.3,
  iridescenceThicknessRange: [100, 400],
  iridescenceMap: iridTexture,
  iridescenceThicknessMap: iridThickTexture,

  // Anisotropy (brushed metal)
  anisotropy: 1.0,
  anisotropyRotation: 0,
  anisotropyMap: anisoTexture,

  // Specular
  specularIntensity: 1,
  specularColor: new THREE.Color(0xffffff),
  specularIntensityMap: specIntTexture,
  specularColorMap: specColorTexture,

  metalness: 0.9,
  roughness: 0.5,
  clearcoat: 1,
  clearcoatRoughness: 0.1,
});
```

## MeshToonMaterial

Cel-shaded cartoon look.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshToonMaterial({
  color: 0x00ff00,
  gradientMap: gradientTexture, // Optional: custom shading gradient
});

// Create step gradient texture
const colors = new Uint8Array([0, 128, 255]);
const gradientMap = new THREE.DataTexture(colors, 3, 1, THREE.RedFormat);
gradientMap.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
gradientMap.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
gradientMap.needsUpdate = true;
```

## MeshNormalMaterial

Visualize surface normals. Useful for debugging.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial({
  flatShading: false,
  wireframe: false,
});
```

## MeshDepthMaterial

Render depth values. Used for shadow maps, DOF effects.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshDepthMaterial({
  depthPacking: THREE.RGBADepthPacking,
});
```

## PointsMaterial

For point clouds.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.PointsMaterial({
  color: 0xffffff,
  size: 0.1,
  sizeAttenuation: true, // Scale with distance
  map: pointTexture,
  alphaMap: alphaTexture,
  transparent: true,
  alphaTest: 0.5, // Discard pixels below threshold
  vertexColors: true, // Use per-vertex colors
});

const points = new THREE.Points(geometry, material);
```

## LineBasicMaterial & LineDashedMaterial

```javascript
// Solid lines
const lineMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
  color: 0xffffff,
  linewidth: 1, // Note: >1 only works on some systems
  linecap: "round",
  linejoin: "round",
});

// Dashed lines
const dashedMaterial = new THREE.LineDashedMaterial({
  color: 0xffffff,
  dashSize: 0.5,
  gapSize: 0.25,
  scale: 1,
});

// Required for dashed lines
const line = new THREE.Line(geometry, dashedMaterial);
line.computeLineDistances();
```

## ShaderMaterial

Custom GLSL shaders with Three.js uniforms.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    time: { value: 0 },
    color: { value: new THREE.Color(0xff0000) },
    texture1: { value: texture },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    uniform float time;

    void main() {
      vUv = uv;
      vec3 pos = position;
      pos.z += sin(pos.x * 10.0 + time) * 0.1;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(pos, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    uniform vec3 color;
    uniform sampler2D texture1;

    void main() {
      // Use texture2D() for GLSL 1.0, texture() for GLSL 3.0 (glslVersion: THREE.GLSL3)
      vec4 texColor = texture2D(texture1, vUv);
      gl_FragColor = vec4(color * texColor.rgb, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  transparent: true,
  side: THREE.DoubleSide,
});

// Update uniform in animation loop
material.uniforms.time.value = clock.getElapsedTime();
```

### Built-in Uniforms (auto-provided)

```glsl
// Vertex shader
uniform mat4 modelMatrix;         // Object to world
uniform mat4 modelViewMatrix;     // Object to camera
uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;    // Camera projection
uniform mat4 viewMatrix;          // World to camera
uniform mat3 normalMatrix;        // For transforming normals
uniform vec3 cameraPosition;      // Camera world position

// Attributes
attribute vec3 position;
attribute vec3 normal;
attribute vec2 uv;
```

## RawShaderMaterial

Full control - no built-in uniforms/attributes.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.RawShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    projectionMatrix: { value: camera.projectionMatrix },
    modelViewMatrix: { value: new THREE.Matrix4() },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    precision highp float;
    attribute vec3 position;
    uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;
    uniform mat4 modelViewMatrix;

    void main() {
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    precision highp float;

    void main() {
      gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    }
  `,
});
```

## Common Material Properties

All materials share these base properties:

```javascript
// Visibility
material.visible = true;
material.transparent = false;
material.opacity = 1.0;
material.alphaTest = 0; // Discard pixels with alpha < value

// Rendering
material.side = THREE.FrontSide; // FrontSide, BackSide, DoubleSide
material.depthTest = true;
material.depthWrite = true;
material.colorWrite = true;

// Blending
material.blending = THREE.NormalBlending;
// NormalBlending, AdditiveBlending, SubtractiveBlending, MultiplyBlending, CustomBlending

// Stencil
material.stencilWrite = false;
material.stencilFunc = THREE.AlwaysStencilFunc;
material.stencilRef = 0;
material.stencilMask = 0xff;

// Polygon offset (z-fighting fix)
material.polygonOffset = false;
material.polygonOffsetFactor = 0;
material.polygonOffsetUnits = 0;

// Misc
material.dithering = false;
material.toneMapped = true;
```

## Multiple Materials

```javascript
// Assign different materials to geometry groups
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const materials = [
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 }), // right
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 }), // left
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff }), // top
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffff00 }), // bottom
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff00ff }), // front
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ffff }), // back
];
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, materials);

// Custom groups
geometry.clearGroups();
geometry.addGroup(0, 6, 0); // start, count, materialIndex
geometry.addGroup(6, 6, 1);
```

## Environment Maps

```javascript
// Load cube texture
const cubeLoader = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader();
const envMap = cubeLoader.load([
  "px.jpg",
  "nx.jpg", // positive/negative X
  "py.jpg",
  "ny.jpg", // positive/negative Y
  "pz.jpg",
  "nz.jpg", // positive/negative Z
]);

// Apply to material
material.envMap = envMap;
material.envMapIntensity = 1;

// Or set as scene environment (affects all PBR materials)
scene.environment = envMap;

// HDR environment (recommended)
import { RGBELoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/RGBELoader.js";
const rgbeLoader = new RGBELoader();
rgbeLoader.load("environment.hdr", (texture) => {
  texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
  scene.environment = texture;
  scene.background = texture;
});
```

## Material Cloning and Modification

```javascript
// Clone material
const clone = material.clone();
clone.color.set(0x00ff00);

// Modify at runtime
material.color.set(0xff0000);
material.needsUpdate = true; // Only needed for some changes

// When needsUpdate is required:
// - Changing flat shading
// - Changing texture
// - Changing transparent
// - Custom shader code changes
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Reuse materials**: Same material = batched draw calls
2. **Avoid transparent when possible**: Transparent materials require sorting
3. **Use alphaTest instead of transparency**: When applicable, faster
4. **Choose simpler materials**: Basic > Lambert > Phong > Standard > Physical
5. **Limit active lights**: Each light adds shader complexity

```javascript
// Material pooling
const materialCache = new Map();
function getMaterial(color) {
  const key = color.toString(16);
  if (!materialCache.has(key)) {
    materialCache.set(key, new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color }));
  }
  return materialCache.get(key);
}

// Dispose when done
material.dispose();
```

# Three.js Post-Processing

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { EffectComposer } from "three/addons/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js";
import { RenderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/RenderPass.js";
import { UnrealBloomPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/UnrealBloomPass.js";

// Setup composer
const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer);

// Render scene
const renderPass = new RenderPass(scene, camera);
composer.addPass(renderPass);

// Add bloom
const bloomPass = new UnrealBloomPass(
  new THREE.Vector2(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight),
  1.5, // strength
  0.4, // radius
  0.85, // threshold
);
composer.addPass(bloomPass);

// Animation loop - use composer instead of renderer
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  composer.render(); // NOT renderer.render()
}
```

## EffectComposer Setup

```javascript
import { EffectComposer } from "three/addons/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js";
import { RenderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/RenderPass.js";

const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer);

// First pass: render scene
const renderPass = new RenderPass(scene, camera);
composer.addPass(renderPass);

// Add more passes...
composer.addPass(effectPass);

// Last pass should render to screen
effectPass.renderToScreen = true; // Default for last pass

// Handle resize
function onResize() {
  const width = window.innerWidth;
  const height = window.innerHeight;

  camera.aspect = width / height;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();

  renderer.setSize(width, height);
  composer.setSize(width, height);
}
```

## Common Effects

### Bloom (Glow)

```javascript
import { UnrealBloomPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/UnrealBloomPass.js";

const bloomPass = new UnrealBloomPass(
  new THREE.Vector2(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight),
  1.5, // strength - intensity of glow
  0.4, // radius - spread of glow
  0.85, // threshold - brightness threshold
);

composer.addPass(bloomPass);

// Adjust at runtime
bloomPass.strength = 2.0;
bloomPass.threshold = 0.5;
bloomPass.radius = 0.8;
```

### Selective Bloom

Apply bloom only to specific objects.

```javascript
import { UnrealBloomPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/UnrealBloomPass.js";
import { ShaderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/ShaderPass.js";

// Layer setup
const BLOOM_LAYER = 1;
const bloomLayer = new THREE.Layers();
bloomLayer.set(BLOOM_LAYER);

// Mark objects to bloom
glowingMesh.layers.enable(BLOOM_LAYER);

// Dark material for non-blooming objects
const darkMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x000000 });
const materials = {};

function darkenNonBloomed(obj) {
  if (obj.isMesh && !bloomLayer.test(obj.layers)) {
    materials[obj.uuid] = obj.material;
    obj.material = darkMaterial;
  }
}

function restoreMaterial(obj) {
  if (materials[obj.uuid]) {
    obj.material = materials[obj.uuid];
    delete materials[obj.uuid];
  }
}

// Custom render loop
function render() {
  // Render bloom pass
  scene.traverse(darkenNonBloomed);
  composer.render();
  scene.traverse(restoreMaterial);

  // Render final scene over bloom
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

### FXAA (Anti-Aliasing)

```javascript
import { ShaderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/ShaderPass.js";
import { FXAAShader } from "three/addons/shaders/FXAAShader.js";

const fxaaPass = new ShaderPass(FXAAShader);
fxaaPass.material.uniforms["resolution"].value.set(
  1 / window.innerWidth,
  1 / window.innerHeight,
);

composer.addPass(fxaaPass);

// Update on resize
function onResize() {
  fxaaPass.material.uniforms["resolution"].value.set(
    1 / window.innerWidth,
    1 / window.innerHeight,
  );
}
```

### SMAA (Better Anti-Aliasing)

```javascript
import { SMAAPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/SMAAPass.js";

const smaaPass = new SMAAPass(
  window.innerWidth * renderer.getPixelRatio(),
  window.innerHeight * renderer.getPixelRatio(),
);

composer.addPass(smaaPass);
```

### SSAO (Ambient Occlusion)

```javascript
import { SSAOPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/SSAOPass.js";

const ssaoPass = new SSAOPass(
  scene,
  camera,
  window.innerWidth,
  window.innerHeight,
);
ssaoPass.kernelRadius = 16;
ssaoPass.minDistance = 0.005;
ssaoPass.maxDistance = 0.1;

composer.addPass(ssaoPass);

// Output modes
ssaoPass.output = SSAOPass.OUTPUT.Default;
// SSAOPass.OUTPUT.Default - Final composited output
// SSAOPass.OUTPUT.SSAO - Just the AO
// SSAOPass.OUTPUT.Blur - Blurred AO
// SSAOPass.OUTPUT.Depth - Depth buffer
// SSAOPass.OUTPUT.Normal - Normal buffer
```

### Depth of Field (DOF)

```javascript
import { BokehPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/BokehPass.js";

const bokehPass = new BokehPass(scene, camera, {
  focus: 10.0, // Focus distance
  aperture: 0.025, // Aperture (smaller = more DOF)
  maxblur: 0.01, // Max blur amount
});

composer.addPass(bokehPass);

// Update focus dynamically
bokehPass.uniforms["focus"].value = distanceToTarget;
```

### Film Grain

```javascript
import { FilmPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/FilmPass.js";

const filmPass = new FilmPass(
  0.35, // noise intensity
  0.5, // scanline intensity
  648, // scanline count
  false, // grayscale
);

composer.addPass(filmPass);
```

### Vignette

```javascript
import { ShaderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/ShaderPass.js";
import { VignetteShader } from "three/addons/shaders/VignetteShader.js";

const vignettePass = new ShaderPass(VignetteShader);
vignettePass.uniforms["offset"].value = 1.0; // Vignette size
vignettePass.uniforms["darkness"].value = 1.0; // Vignette intensity

composer.addPass(vignettePass);
```

### Color Correction

```javascript
import { ShaderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/ShaderPass.js";
import { ColorCorrectionShader } from "three/addons/shaders/ColorCorrectionShader.js";

const colorPass = new ShaderPass(ColorCorrectionShader);
colorPass.uniforms["powRGB"].value = new THREE.Vector3(1.2, 1.2, 1.2); // Power
colorPass.uniforms["mulRGB"].value = new THREE.Vector3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0); // Multiply

composer.addPass(colorPass);
```

### Gamma Correction

```javascript
import { GammaCorrectionShader } from "three/addons/shaders/GammaCorrectionShader.js";

const gammaPass = new ShaderPass(GammaCorrectionShader);
composer.addPass(gammaPass);
```

### Pixelation

```javascript
import { RenderPixelatedPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/RenderPixelatedPass.js";

const pixelPass = new RenderPixelatedPass(6, scene, camera); // 6 = pixel size

composer.addPass(pixelPass);
```

### Glitch Effect

```javascript
import { GlitchPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/GlitchPass.js";

const glitchPass = new GlitchPass();
glitchPass.goWild = false; // Continuous glitching

composer.addPass(glitchPass);
```

### Halftone

```javascript
import { HalftonePass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/HalftonePass.js";

const halftonePass = new HalftonePass(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, {
  shape: 1, // 1 = dot, 2 = ellipse, 3 = line, 4 = square
  radius: 4, // Dot size
  rotateR: Math.PI / 12,
  rotateB: (Math.PI / 12) * 2,
  rotateG: (Math.PI / 12) * 3,
  scatter: 0,
  blending: 1,
  blendingMode: 1,
  greyscale: false,
});

composer.addPass(halftonePass);
```

### Outline

```javascript
import { OutlinePass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/OutlinePass.js";

const outlinePass = new OutlinePass(
  new THREE.Vector2(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight),
  scene,
  camera,
);

outlinePass.edgeStrength = 3;
outlinePass.edgeGlow = 0;
outlinePass.edgeThickness = 1;
outlinePass.pulsePeriod = 0;
outlinePass.visibleEdgeColor.set(0xffffff);
outlinePass.hiddenEdgeColor.set(0x190a05);

// Select objects to outline
outlinePass.selectedObjects = [mesh1, mesh2];

composer.addPass(outlinePass);
```

## Custom ShaderPass

Create your own post-processing effects.

```javascript
import { ShaderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/ShaderPass.js";

const CustomShader = {
  uniforms: {
    tDiffuse: { value: null }, // Required: input texture
    time: { value: 0 },
    intensity: { value: 1.0 },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;

    void main() {
      vUv = uv;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    uniform sampler2D tDiffuse;
    uniform float time;
    uniform float intensity;
    varying vec2 vUv;

    void main() {
      vec2 uv = vUv;

      // Wave distortion
      uv.x += sin(uv.y * 10.0 + time) * 0.01 * intensity;

      vec4 color = texture2D(tDiffuse, uv);
      gl_FragColor = color;
    }
  `,
};

const customPass = new ShaderPass(CustomShader);
composer.addPass(customPass);

// Update in animation loop
customPass.uniforms.time.value = clock.getElapsedTime();
```

### Invert Colors Shader

```javascript
const InvertShader = {
  uniforms: {
    tDiffuse: { value: null },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    void main() {
      vUv = uv;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    uniform sampler2D tDiffuse;
    varying vec2 vUv;

    void main() {
      vec4 color = texture2D(tDiffuse, vUv);
      gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0 - color.rgb, color.a);
    }
  `,
};
```

### Chromatic Aberration

```javascript
const ChromaticAberrationShader = {
  uniforms: {
    tDiffuse: { value: null },
    amount: { value: 0.005 },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    void main() {
      vUv = uv;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    uniform sampler2D tDiffuse;
    uniform float amount;
    varying vec2 vUv;

    void main() {
      vec2 dir = vUv - 0.5;
      float dist = length(dir);

      float r = texture2D(tDiffuse, vUv - dir * amount * dist).r;
      float g = texture2D(tDiffuse, vUv).g;
      float b = texture2D(tDiffuse, vUv + dir * amount * dist).b;

      gl_FragColor = vec4(r, g, b, 1.0);
    }
  `,
};
```

## Combining Multiple Effects

```javascript
import { EffectComposer } from "three/addons/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js";
import { RenderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/RenderPass.js";
import { UnrealBloomPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/UnrealBloomPass.js";
import { ShaderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/ShaderPass.js";
import { FXAAShader } from "three/addons/shaders/FXAAShader.js";
import { VignetteShader } from "three/addons/shaders/VignetteShader.js";
import { GammaCorrectionShader } from "three/addons/shaders/GammaCorrectionShader.js";

const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer);

// 1. Render scene
composer.addPass(new RenderPass(scene, camera));

// 2. Bloom
const bloomPass = new UnrealBloomPass(
  new THREE.Vector2(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight),
  0.5,
  0.4,
  0.85,
);
composer.addPass(bloomPass);

// 3. Vignette
const vignettePass = new ShaderPass(VignetteShader);
vignettePass.uniforms["offset"].value = 0.95;
vignettePass.uniforms["darkness"].value = 1.0;
composer.addPass(vignettePass);

// 4. Gamma correction
composer.addPass(new ShaderPass(GammaCorrectionShader));

// 5. Anti-aliasing (always last before output)
const fxaaPass = new ShaderPass(FXAAShader);
fxaaPass.uniforms["resolution"].value.set(
  1 / window.innerWidth,
  1 / window.innerHeight,
);
composer.addPass(fxaaPass);
```

## Render to Texture

```javascript
// Create render target
const renderTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(512, 512);

// Render scene to target
renderer.setRenderTarget(renderTarget);
renderer.render(scene, camera);
renderer.setRenderTarget(null);

// Use texture
const texture = renderTarget.texture;
otherMaterial.map = texture;
```

## Multi-Pass Rendering

```javascript
// Multiple composers for different scenes/layers
const bgComposer = new EffectComposer(renderer);
bgComposer.addPass(new RenderPass(bgScene, camera));

const fgComposer = new EffectComposer(renderer);
fgComposer.addPass(new RenderPass(fgScene, camera));
fgComposer.addPass(bloomPass);

// Combine in render loop
function animate() {
  // Render background without clearing
  renderer.autoClear = false;
  renderer.clear();

  bgComposer.render();

  // Render foreground over it
  renderer.clearDepth();
  fgComposer.render();
}
```

## WebGPU Post-Processing (Three.js r150+)

```javascript
import { postProcessing } from "three/addons/nodes/Nodes.js";
import { pass, bloom, dof } from "three/addons/nodes/Nodes.js";

// Using node-based system
const scenePass = pass(scene, camera);
const bloomNode = bloom(scenePass, 0.5, 0.4, 0.85);

const postProcessing = new THREE.PostProcessing(renderer);
postProcessing.outputNode = bloomNode;

// Render
function animate() {
  postProcessing.render();
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Limit passes**: Each pass adds a full-screen render
2. **Lower resolution**: Use smaller render targets for blur passes
3. **Disable unused effects**: Toggle passes on/off
4. **Use FXAA over MSAA**: Less expensive anti-aliasing
5. **Profile with DevTools**: Check GPU usage

```javascript
// Disable pass
bloomPass.enabled = false;

// Reduce bloom resolution
const bloomPass = new UnrealBloomPass(
  new THREE.Vector2(window.innerWidth / 2, window.innerHeight / 2),
  strength,
  radius,
  threshold,
);

// Only apply effects in high-performance scenarios
const isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
if (!isMobile) {
  composer.addPass(expensivePass);
}
```

## Handle Resize

```javascript
function onWindowResize() {
  const width = window.innerWidth;
  const height = window.innerHeight;
  const pixelRatio = renderer.getPixelRatio();

  camera.aspect = width / height;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();

  renderer.setSize(width, height);
  composer.setSize(width, height);

  // Update pass-specific resolutions
  if (fxaaPass) {
    fxaaPass.material.uniforms["resolution"].value.set(
      1 / (width * pixelRatio),
      1 / (height * pixelRatio),
    );
  }

  if (bloomPass) {
    bloomPass.resolution.set(width, height);
  }
}

window.addEventListener("resize", onWindowResize);
```

# Three.js Shaders

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    time: { value: 0 },
    color: { value: new THREE.Color(0xff0000) },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    void main() {
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    uniform vec3 color;

    void main() {
      gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
    }
  `,
});

// Update in animation loop
material.uniforms.time.value = clock.getElapsedTime();
```

## ShaderMaterial vs RawShaderMaterial

### ShaderMaterial

Three.js provides built-in uniforms and attributes.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader: `
    // Built-in uniforms available:
    // uniform mat4 modelMatrix;
    // uniform mat4 modelViewMatrix;
    // uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;
    // uniform mat4 viewMatrix;
    // uniform mat3 normalMatrix;
    // uniform vec3 cameraPosition;

    // Built-in attributes available:
    // attribute vec3 position;
    // attribute vec3 normal;
    // attribute vec2 uv;

    void main() {
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    void main() {
      gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    }
  `,
});
```

### RawShaderMaterial

Full control - you define everything.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.RawShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    projectionMatrix: { value: camera.projectionMatrix },
    modelViewMatrix: { value: new THREE.Matrix4() },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    precision highp float;

    attribute vec3 position;
    uniform mat4 projectionMatrix;
    uniform mat4 modelViewMatrix;

    void main() {
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    precision highp float;

    void main() {
      gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    }
  `,
});
```

## Uniforms

### Uniform Types

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    // Numbers
    floatValue: { value: 1.5 },
    intValue: { value: 1 },

    // Vectors
    vec2Value: { value: new THREE.Vector2(1, 2) },
    vec3Value: { value: new THREE.Vector3(1, 2, 3) },
    vec4Value: { value: new THREE.Vector4(1, 2, 3, 4) },

    // Colors (converted to vec3)
    colorValue: { value: new THREE.Color(0xff0000) },

    // Matrices
    mat3Value: { value: new THREE.Matrix3() },
    mat4Value: { value: new THREE.Matrix4() },

    // Textures
    textureValue: { value: texture },
    cubeTextureValue: { value: cubeTexture },

    // Arrays
    floatArray: { value: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] },
    vec3Array: {
      value: [new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0), new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0)],
    },
  },
});
```

### GLSL Declarations

```glsl
// In shader
uniform float floatValue;
uniform int intValue;
uniform vec2 vec2Value;
uniform vec3 vec3Value;
uniform vec3 colorValue;    // Color becomes vec3
uniform vec4 vec4Value;
uniform mat3 mat3Value;
uniform mat4 mat4Value;
uniform sampler2D textureValue;
uniform samplerCube cubeTextureValue;
uniform float floatArray[3];
uniform vec3 vec3Array[2];
```

### Updating Uniforms

```javascript
// Direct assignment
material.uniforms.time.value = clock.getElapsedTime();

// Vector/Color updates
material.uniforms.position.value.set(x, y, z);
material.uniforms.color.value.setHSL(hue, 1, 0.5);

// Matrix updates
material.uniforms.matrix.value.copy(mesh.matrixWorld);
```

## Varyings

Pass data from vertex to fragment shader.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    varying vec3 vNormal;
    varying vec3 vPosition;

    void main() {
      vUv = uv;
      vNormal = normalize(normalMatrix * normal);
      vPosition = (modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0)).xyz;

      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    varying vec3 vNormal;
    varying vec3 vPosition;

    void main() {
      // Use interpolated values
      gl_FragColor = vec4(vNormal * 0.5 + 0.5, 1.0);
    }
  `,
});
```

## Common Shader Patterns

### Texture Sampling

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    map: { value: texture },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;

    void main() {
      vUv = uv;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    uniform sampler2D map;
    varying vec2 vUv;

    void main() {
      vec4 texColor = texture2D(map, vUv);
      gl_FragColor = texColor;
    }
  `,
});
```

### Vertex Displacement

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    time: { value: 0 },
    amplitude: { value: 0.5 },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    uniform float time;
    uniform float amplitude;

    void main() {
      vec3 pos = position;

      // Wave displacement
      pos.z += sin(pos.x * 5.0 + time) * amplitude;
      pos.z += sin(pos.y * 5.0 + time) * amplitude;

      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(pos, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    void main() {
      gl_FragColor = vec4(0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0);
    }
  `,
});
```

### Fresnel Effect

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec3 vNormal;
    varying vec3 vWorldPosition;

    void main() {
      vNormal = normalize(normalMatrix * normal);
      vWorldPosition = (modelMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0)).xyz;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    varying vec3 vNormal;
    varying vec3 vWorldPosition;

    void main() {
      // cameraPosition is auto-provided by ShaderMaterial
      vec3 viewDirection = normalize(cameraPosition - vWorldPosition);
      float fresnel = pow(1.0 - dot(viewDirection, vNormal), 3.0);

      vec3 baseColor = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.5);
      vec3 fresnelColor = vec3(0.5, 0.8, 1.0);

      gl_FragColor = vec4(mix(baseColor, fresnelColor, fresnel), 1.0);
    }
  `,
});
```

### Noise-Based Effects

```glsl
// Simple noise function
float random(vec2 st) {
  return fract(sin(dot(st.xy, vec2(12.9898, 78.233))) * 43758.5453);
}

// Value noise
float noise(vec2 st) {
  vec2 i = floor(st);
  vec2 f = fract(st);

  float a = random(i);
  float b = random(i + vec2(1.0, 0.0));
  float c = random(i + vec2(0.0, 1.0));
  float d = random(i + vec2(1.0, 1.0));

  vec2 u = f * f * (3.0 - 2.0 * f);

  return mix(a, b, u.x) + (c - a) * u.y * (1.0 - u.x) + (d - b) * u.x * u.y;
}

// Usage
float n = noise(vUv * 10.0 + time);
```

### Gradient

```glsl
// Linear gradient
vec3 color = mix(colorA, colorB, vUv.y);

// Radial gradient
float dist = distance(vUv, vec2(0.5));
vec3 color = mix(centerColor, edgeColor, dist * 2.0);

// Smooth gradient with custom curve
float t = smoothstep(0.0, 1.0, vUv.y);
vec3 color = mix(colorA, colorB, t);
```

### Rim Lighting

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec3 vNormal;
    varying vec3 vViewPosition;

    void main() {
      vNormal = normalize(normalMatrix * normal);
      vec4 mvPosition = modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
      vViewPosition = mvPosition.xyz;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * mvPosition;
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    varying vec3 vNormal;
    varying vec3 vViewPosition;

    void main() {
      vec3 viewDir = normalize(-vViewPosition);
      float rim = 1.0 - max(0.0, dot(viewDir, vNormal));
      rim = pow(rim, 4.0);

      vec3 baseColor = vec3(0.2, 0.2, 0.8);
      vec3 rimColor = vec3(1.0, 0.5, 0.0);

      gl_FragColor = vec4(baseColor + rimColor * rim, 1.0);
    }
  `,
});
```

### Dissolve Effect

```glsl
uniform float progress;
uniform sampler2D noiseMap;

void main() {
  float noise = texture2D(noiseMap, vUv).r;

  if (noise < progress) {
    discard;
  }

  // Edge glow
  float edge = smoothstep(progress, progress + 0.1, noise);
  vec3 edgeColor = vec3(1.0, 0.5, 0.0);
  vec3 baseColor = vec3(0.5);

  gl_FragColor = vec4(mix(edgeColor, baseColor, edge), 1.0);
}
```

## Extending Built-in Materials

### onBeforeCompile

Modify existing material shaders.

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });

material.onBeforeCompile = (shader) => {
  // Add custom uniform
  shader.uniforms.time = { value: 0 };

  // Store reference for updates
  material.userData.shader = shader;

  // Modify vertex shader
  shader.vertexShader = shader.vertexShader.replace(
    "#include <begin_vertex>",
    `
    #include <begin_vertex>
    transformed.y += sin(position.x * 10.0 + time) * 0.1;
    `,
  );

  // Add uniform declaration
  shader.vertexShader = "uniform float time;\n" + shader.vertexShader;
};

// Update in animation loop
if (material.userData.shader) {
  material.userData.shader.uniforms.time.value = clock.getElapsedTime();
}
```

### Common Injection Points

```javascript
// Vertex shader chunks
"#include <begin_vertex>"; // After position is calculated
"#include <project_vertex>"; // After gl_Position
"#include <beginnormal_vertex>"; // Normal calculation start

// Fragment shader chunks
"#include <color_fragment>"; // After diffuse color
"#include <output_fragment>"; // Final output
"#include <fog_fragment>"; // After fog applied
```

## GLSL Built-in Functions

### Math Functions

```glsl
// Basic
abs(x), sign(x), floor(x), ceil(x), fract(x)
mod(x, y), min(x, y), max(x, y), clamp(x, min, max)
mix(a, b, t), step(edge, x), smoothstep(edge0, edge1, x)

// Trigonometry
sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)
asin(x), acos(x), atan(y, x), atan(x)
radians(degrees), degrees(radians)

// Exponential
pow(x, y), exp(x), log(x), exp2(x), log2(x)
sqrt(x), inversesqrt(x)
```

### Vector Functions

```glsl
// Length and distance
length(v), distance(p0, p1), dot(x, y), cross(x, y)

// Normalization
normalize(v)

// Reflection and refraction
reflect(I, N), refract(I, N, eta)

// Component-wise
lessThan(x, y), lessThanEqual(x, y)
greaterThan(x, y), greaterThanEqual(x, y)
equal(x, y), notEqual(x, y)
any(bvec), all(bvec)
```

### Texture Functions

```glsl
// GLSL 1.0 (default) - use texture2D/textureCube
texture2D(sampler, coord)
texture2D(sampler, coord, bias)
textureCube(sampler, coord)

// GLSL 3.0 (glslVersion: THREE.GLSL3) - use texture()
// texture(sampler, coord) replaces texture2D/textureCube
// Also use: out vec4 fragColor instead of gl_FragColor

// Texture size (GLSL 1.30+)
textureSize(sampler, lod)
```

## Common Material Properties

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    /* ... */
  },
  vertexShader: "/* ... */",
  fragmentShader: "/* ... */",

  // Rendering
  transparent: true,
  opacity: 1.0,
  side: THREE.DoubleSide,
  depthTest: true,
  depthWrite: true,

  // Blending
  blending: THREE.NormalBlending,
  // AdditiveBlending, SubtractiveBlending, MultiplyBlending

  // Wireframe
  wireframe: false,
  wireframeLinewidth: 1, // Note: >1 has no effect on most platforms (WebGL limitation)

  // Extensions
  extensions: {
    derivatives: true, // For fwidth, dFdx, dFdy
    fragDepth: true, // gl_FragDepth
    drawBuffers: true, // Multiple render targets
    shaderTextureLOD: true, // texture2DLod
  },

  // GLSL version
  glslVersion: THREE.GLSL3, // For WebGL2 features
});
```

## Shader Includes

### Using Three.js Shader Chunks

```javascript
import { ShaderChunk } from "three";

const fragmentShader = `
  ${ShaderChunk.common}
  ${ShaderChunk.packing}

  uniform sampler2D depthTexture;
  varying vec2 vUv;

  void main() {
    float depth = texture2D(depthTexture, vUv).r;
    float linearDepth = perspectiveDepthToViewZ(depth, 0.1, 1000.0);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(vec3(-linearDepth / 100.0), 1.0);
  }
`;
```

### External Shader Files

```javascript
// With vite/webpack
import vertexShader from "./shaders/vertex.glsl";
import fragmentShader from "./shaders/fragment.glsl";

const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader,
  fragmentShader,
});
```

## Instanced Shaders

```javascript
// Instanced attribute
const offsets = new Float32Array(instanceCount * 3);
// Fill offsets...
geometry.setAttribute("offset", new THREE.InstancedBufferAttribute(offsets, 3));

const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader: `
    attribute vec3 offset;

    void main() {
      vec3 pos = position + offset;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(pos, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    void main() {
      gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    }
  `,
});
```

## Debugging Shaders

```javascript
// Check for compile errors
material.onBeforeCompile = (shader) => {
  console.log("Vertex Shader:", shader.vertexShader);
  console.log("Fragment Shader:", shader.fragmentShader);
};

// Visual debugging
fragmentShader: `
  void main() {
    // Debug UV
    gl_FragColor = vec4(vUv, 0.0, 1.0);

    // Debug normals
    gl_FragColor = vec4(vNormal * 0.5 + 0.5, 1.0);

    // Debug position
    gl_FragColor = vec4(vPosition * 0.1 + 0.5, 1.0);
  }
`;

// Check WebGL errors
renderer.debug.checkShaderErrors = true;
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Minimize uniforms**: Group related values into vectors
2. **Avoid conditionals**: Use mix/step instead of if/else
3. **Precalculate**: Move calculations to JS when possible
4. **Use textures**: For complex functions, use lookup tables
5. **Limit overdraw**: Avoid transparent objects when possible

```glsl
// Instead of:
if (value > 0.5) {
  color = colorA;
} else {
  color = colorB;
}

// Use:
color = mix(colorB, colorA, step(0.5, value));
```

# Three.js Textures

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

// Load texture
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = loader.load("texture.jpg");

// Apply to material
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  map: texture,
});
```

## Texture Loading

### Basic Loading

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

// Async with callbacks
loader.load(
  "texture.jpg",
  (texture) => console.log("Loaded"),
  (progress) => console.log("Progress"),
  (error) => console.error("Error"),
);

// Synchronous style (loads async internally)
const texture = loader.load("texture.jpg");
material.map = texture;
```

### Promise Wrapper

```javascript
function loadTexture(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    new THREE.TextureLoader().load(url, resolve, undefined, reject);
  });
}

// Usage
const [colorMap, normalMap, roughnessMap] = await Promise.all([
  loadTexture("color.jpg"),
  loadTexture("normal.jpg"),
  loadTexture("roughness.jpg"),
]);
```

## Texture Configuration

### Color Space

Critical for accurate color reproduction.

```javascript
// Color/albedo textures - use sRGB
colorTexture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;

// Data textures (normal, roughness, metalness, AO) - leave as default
// Do NOT set colorSpace for data textures (NoColorSpace is default)
```

### Wrapping Modes

```javascript
texture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping; // Horizontal
texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping; // Vertical

// Options:
// THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping - Stretches edge pixels (default)
// THREE.RepeatWrapping - Tiles the texture
// THREE.MirroredRepeatWrapping - Tiles with mirror flip
```

### Repeat, Offset, Rotation

```javascript
// Tile texture 4x4
texture.repeat.set(4, 4);
texture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;

// Offset (0-1 range)
texture.offset.set(0.5, 0.5);

// Rotation (radians, around center)
texture.rotation = Math.PI / 4;
texture.center.set(0.5, 0.5); // Rotation pivot
```

### Filtering

```javascript
// Minification (texture larger than screen pixels)
texture.minFilter = THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter; // Default, smooth
texture.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter; // Pixelated
texture.minFilter = THREE.LinearFilter; // Smooth, no mipmaps

// Magnification (texture smaller than screen pixels)
texture.magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter; // Smooth (default)
texture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter; // Pixelated (retro games)

// Anisotropic filtering (sharper at angles)
texture.anisotropy = renderer.capabilities.getMaxAnisotropy();
```

### Generate Mipmaps

```javascript
// Usually true by default
texture.generateMipmaps = true;

// Disable for non-power-of-2 textures or data textures
texture.generateMipmaps = false;
texture.minFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;
```

## Texture Types

### Regular Texture

```javascript
const texture = new THREE.Texture(image);
texture.needsUpdate = true;
```

### Data Texture

Create texture from raw data.

```javascript
// Create gradient texture
const size = 256;
const data = new Uint8Array(size * size * 4);

for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < size; j++) {
    const index = (i * size + j) * 4;
    data[index] = i; // R
    data[index + 1] = j; // G
    data[index + 2] = 128; // B
    data[index + 3] = 255; // A
  }
}

const texture = new THREE.DataTexture(data, size, size);
texture.needsUpdate = true;
```

### Canvas Texture

```javascript
const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
canvas.width = 256;
canvas.height = 256;
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

// Draw on canvas
ctx.fillStyle = "red";
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 256, 256);
ctx.fillStyle = "white";
ctx.font = "48px Arial";
ctx.fillText("Hello", 50, 150);

const texture = new THREE.CanvasTexture(canvas);

// Update when canvas changes
texture.needsUpdate = true;
```

### Video Texture

```javascript
const video = document.createElement("video");
video.src = "video.mp4";
video.loop = true;
video.muted = true;
video.play();

const texture = new THREE.VideoTexture(video);
texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;

// No need to set needsUpdate - auto-updates
```

### Compressed Textures

```javascript
import { KTX2Loader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/KTX2Loader.js";

const ktx2Loader = new KTX2Loader();
ktx2Loader.setTranscoderPath("path/to/basis/");
ktx2Loader.detectSupport(renderer);

ktx2Loader.load("texture.ktx2", (texture) => {
  material.map = texture;
});
```

## Cube Textures

For environment maps and skyboxes.

### CubeTextureLoader

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader();
const cubeTexture = loader.load([
  "px.jpg",
  "nx.jpg", // +X, -X
  "py.jpg",
  "ny.jpg", // +Y, -Y
  "pz.jpg",
  "nz.jpg", // +Z, -Z
]);

// As background
scene.background = cubeTexture;

// As environment map
scene.environment = cubeTexture;
material.envMap = cubeTexture;
```

### Equirectangular to Cubemap

```javascript
import { RGBELoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/RGBELoader.js";

const pmremGenerator = new THREE.PMREMGenerator(renderer);
pmremGenerator.compileEquirectangularShader();

new RGBELoader().load("environment.hdr", (texture) => {
  const envMap = pmremGenerator.fromEquirectangular(texture).texture;
  scene.environment = envMap;
  scene.background = envMap;

  texture.dispose();
  pmremGenerator.dispose();
});
```

## HDR Textures

### RGBELoader

```javascript
import { RGBELoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/RGBELoader.js";

const loader = new RGBELoader();
loader.load("environment.hdr", (texture) => {
  texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
  scene.environment = texture;
  scene.background = texture;
});
```

### EXRLoader

```javascript
import { EXRLoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/EXRLoader.js";

const loader = new EXRLoader();
loader.load("environment.exr", (texture) => {
  texture.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
  scene.environment = texture;
});
```

### Background Options

```javascript
scene.background = texture;
scene.backgroundBlurriness = 0.5; // 0-1, blur background
scene.backgroundIntensity = 1.0; // Brightness
scene.backgroundRotation.y = Math.PI; // Rotate background
```

## Render Targets

Render to texture for effects.

```javascript
// Create render target
const renderTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(512, 512, {
  minFilter: THREE.LinearFilter,
  magFilter: THREE.LinearFilter,
  format: THREE.RGBAFormat,
});

// Render scene to target
renderer.setRenderTarget(renderTarget);
renderer.render(scene, camera);
renderer.setRenderTarget(null); // Back to screen

// Use as texture
material.map = renderTarget.texture;
```

### Depth Texture

```javascript
const renderTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(512, 512);
renderTarget.depthTexture = new THREE.DepthTexture(
  512,
  512,
  THREE.UnsignedShortType,
);

// Access depth
const depthTexture = renderTarget.depthTexture;
```

### Multi-Sample Render Target

```javascript
const renderTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(512, 512, {
  samples: 4, // MSAA
});
```

## CubeCamera

Dynamic environment maps for reflections.

```javascript
const cubeRenderTarget = new THREE.WebGLCubeRenderTarget(256, {
  generateMipmaps: true,
  minFilter: THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter,
});

const cubeCamera = new THREE.CubeCamera(0.1, 1000, cubeRenderTarget);
scene.add(cubeCamera);

// Apply to reflective material
reflectiveMaterial.envMap = cubeRenderTarget.texture;

// Update in animation loop (expensive!)
function animate() {
  // Hide reflective object, update env map, show again
  reflectiveObject.visible = false;
  cubeCamera.position.copy(reflectiveObject.position);
  cubeCamera.update(renderer, scene);
  reflectiveObject.visible = true;
}
```

## UV Mapping

### Accessing UVs

```javascript
const uvs = geometry.attributes.uv;

// Read UV
const u = uvs.getX(vertexIndex);
const v = uvs.getY(vertexIndex);

// Modify UV
uvs.setXY(vertexIndex, newU, newV);
uvs.needsUpdate = true;
```

### Second UV Channel (for AO maps)

```javascript
// Required for aoMap
geometry.setAttribute("uv2", geometry.attributes.uv);

// Or create custom second UV
const uv2 = new Float32Array(vertexCount * 2);
// ... fill uv2 data
geometry.setAttribute("uv2", new THREE.BufferAttribute(uv2, 2));
```

### UV Transform in Shader

```javascript
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    map: { value: texture },
    uvOffset: { value: new THREE.Vector2(0, 0) },
    uvScale: { value: new THREE.Vector2(1, 1) },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    uniform vec2 uvOffset;
    uniform vec2 uvScale;

    void main() {
      vUv = uv * uvScale + uvOffset;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    uniform sampler2D map;

    void main() {
      gl_FragColor = texture2D(map, vUv);
    }
  `,
});
```

## Texture Atlas

Multiple images in one texture.

```javascript
// Atlas with 4 sprites (2x2 grid)
const atlas = loader.load("atlas.png");
atlas.wrapS = THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping;
atlas.wrapT = THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping;

// Select sprite by UV offset/scale
function selectSprite(row, col, gridSize = 2) {
  atlas.offset.set(col / gridSize, 1 - (row + 1) / gridSize);
  atlas.repeat.set(1 / gridSize, 1 / gridSize);
}

// Select top-left sprite
selectSprite(0, 0);
```

## Material Texture Maps

### PBR Texture Set

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  // Base color (sRGB)
  map: colorTexture,

  // Surface detail (Linear)
  normalMap: normalTexture,
  normalScale: new THREE.Vector2(1, 1),

  // Roughness (Linear, grayscale)
  roughnessMap: roughnessTexture,
  roughness: 1, // Multiplier

  // Metalness (Linear, grayscale)
  metalnessMap: metalnessTexture,
  metalness: 1, // Multiplier

  // Ambient occlusion (Linear, uses uv2)
  aoMap: aoTexture,
  aoMapIntensity: 1,

  // Self-illumination (sRGB)
  emissiveMap: emissiveTexture,
  emissive: 0xffffff,
  emissiveIntensity: 1,

  // Vertex displacement (Linear)
  displacementMap: displacementTexture,
  displacementScale: 0.1,
  displacementBias: 0,

  // Alpha (Linear)
  alphaMap: alphaTexture,
  transparent: true,
});

// Don''t forget UV2 for AO
geometry.setAttribute("uv2", geometry.attributes.uv);
```

### Normal Map Types

```javascript
// OpenGL style normals (default)
material.normalMapType = THREE.TangentSpaceNormalMap;

// Object space normals
material.normalMapType = THREE.ObjectSpaceNormalMap;
```

## Procedural Textures

### Noise Texture

```javascript
function generateNoiseTexture(size = 256) {
  const data = new Uint8Array(size * size * 4);

  for (let i = 0; i < size * size; i++) {
    const value = Math.random() * 255;
    data[i * 4] = value;
    data[i * 4 + 1] = value;
    data[i * 4 + 2] = value;
    data[i * 4 + 3] = 255;
  }

  const texture = new THREE.DataTexture(data, size, size);
  texture.needsUpdate = true;
  return texture;
}
```

### Gradient Texture

```javascript
function generateGradientTexture(color1, color2, size = 256) {
  const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  canvas.width = size;
  canvas.height = 1;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

  const gradient = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, size, 0);
  gradient.addColorStop(0, color1);
  gradient.addColorStop(1, color2);

  ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, size, 1);

  return new THREE.CanvasTexture(canvas);
}
```

## Texture Memory Management

### Dispose Textures

```javascript
// Single texture
texture.dispose();

// Material textures
function disposeMaterial(material) {
  const maps = [
    "map",
    "normalMap",
    "roughnessMap",
    "metalnessMap",
    "aoMap",
    "emissiveMap",
    "displacementMap",
    "alphaMap",
    "envMap",
    "lightMap",
    "bumpMap",
    "specularMap",
  ];

  maps.forEach((mapName) => {
    if (material[mapName]) {
      material[mapName].dispose();
    }
  });

  material.dispose();
}
```

### Texture Pooling

```javascript
class TexturePool {
  constructor() {
    this.textures = new Map();
    this.loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
  }

  async get(url) {
    if (this.textures.has(url)) {
      return this.textures.get(url);
    }

    const texture = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.loader.load(url, resolve, undefined, reject);
    });

    this.textures.set(url, texture);
    return texture;
  }

  dispose(url) {
    const texture = this.textures.get(url);
    if (texture) {
      texture.dispose();
      this.textures.delete(url);
    }
  }

  disposeAll() {
    this.textures.forEach((t) => t.dispose());
    this.textures.clear();
  }
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use power-of-2 dimensions**: 256, 512, 1024, 2048
2. **Compress textures**: KTX2/Basis for web delivery
3. **Use texture atlases**: Reduce texture switches
4. **Enable mipmaps**: For distant objects
5. **Limit texture size**: 2048 usually sufficient for web
6. **Reuse textures**: Same texture = better batching

```javascript
// Check texture memory
console.log(renderer.info.memory.textures);

// Optimize for mobile
const maxSize = renderer.capabilities.maxTextureSize;
const isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
const textureSize = isMobile ? 1024 : 2048;
```

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Designing new UI components or pages
- Choosing color palettes and typography
- Reviewing code for UX issues
- Building landing pages or dashboards
- Implementing accessibility requirements

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | `ux` |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | `ux` |

| 4 | Layout & Responsive | HIGH | `ux` |
| 5 | Typography & Color | MEDIUM | `typography`, `color` |
| 6 | Animation | MEDIUM | `ux` |
| 7 | Style Selection | MEDIUM | `style`, `product` |
| 8 | Charts & Data | LOW | `chart` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Accessibility (CRITICAL)

- `color-contrast` - Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
- `focus-states` - Visible focus rings on interactive elements
- `alt-text` - Descriptive alt text for meaningful images
- `aria-labels` - aria-label for icon-only buttons
- `keyboard-nav` - Tab order matches visual order
- `form-labels` - Use label with for attribute

### 2. Touch & Interaction (CRITICAL)

- `touch-target-size` - Minimum 44x44px touch targets
- `hover-vs-tap` - Use click/tap for primary interactions
- `loading-buttons` - Disable button during async operations
- `error-feedback` - Clear error messages near problem
- `cursor-pointer` - Add cursor-pointer to clickable elements

### 3. Performance (HIGH)

- `image-optimization` - Use WebP, srcset, lazy loading
- `reduced-motion` - Check prefers-reduced-motion
- `content-jumping` - Reserve space for async content

### 4. Layout & Responsive (HIGH)

- `viewport-meta` - width=device-width initial-scale=1
- `readable-font-size` - Minimum 16px body text on mobile
- `horizontal-scroll` - Ensure content fits viewport width
- `z-index-management` - Define z-index scale (10, 20, 30, 50)

### 5. Typography & Color (MEDIUM)

- `line-height` - Use 1.5-1.75 for body text
- `line-length` - Limit to 65-75 characters per line
- `font-pairing` - Match heading/body font personalities

### 6. Animation (MEDIUM)

- `duration-timing` - Use 150-300ms for micro-interactions
- `transform-performance` - Use transform/opacity, not width/height
- `loading-states` - Skeleton screens or spinners

### 7. Style Selection (MEDIUM)

- `style-match` - Match style to product type
- `consistency` - Use same style across all pages
- `no-emoji-icons` - Use SVG icons, not emojis

### 8. Charts & Data (LOW)

- `data-table` - Provide table alternative for accessibility

## How to Use

Search specific domains using the CLI tool below.

---

## Prerequisites

Check if Python is installed:

```bash
python3 --version || python --version
```

If Python is not installed, install it based on user''s OS:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install python3
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

---

## How to Use This Skill

When user requests UI/UX work (design, build, create, implement, review, fix, improve), follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract key information from user request:
- **Product type**: SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, dashboard, landing page, etc.
- **Style keywords**: minimal, playful, professional, elegant, dark mode, etc.
- **Industry**: healthcare, fintech, gaming, education, etc.
- **Stack**: React, Vue, Next.js, or default to `html-tailwind`

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

**Always start with `--design-system`** to get comprehensive recommendations with reasoning:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

This command:
1. Searches 5 domains in parallel (product, style, color, landing, typography)
2. Applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv` to select best matches
3. Returns complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, effects
4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid

**Example:**
```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "beauty spa wellness service" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```

### Step 2b: Persist Design System (Master + Overrides Pattern)

To save the design system for **hierarchical retrieval across sessions**, add `--persist`:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name"
```

This creates:
- `design-system/MASTER.md` — Global Source of Truth with all design rules
- `design-system/pages/` — Folder for page-specific overrides

**With page-specific override:**
```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name" --page "dashboard"
```

This also creates:
- `design-system/pages/dashboard.md` — Page-specific deviations from Master

**How hierarchical retrieval works:**
1. When building a specific page (e.g., "Checkout"), first check `design-system/pages/checkout.md`
2. If the page file exists, its rules **override** the Master file
3. If not, use `design-system/MASTER.md` exclusively

**Context-aware retrieval prompt:**
```
I am building the [Page Name] page. Please read design-system/MASTER.md.
Also check if design-system/pages/[page-name].md exists.
If the page file exists, prioritize its rules.
If not, use the Master rules exclusively.
Now, generate the code...
```

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

After getting the design system, use domain searches to get additional details:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

**When to use detailed searches:**

| Need | Domain | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| More style options | `style` | `--domain style "glassmorphism dark"` |
| Chart recommendations | `chart` | `--domain chart "real-time dashboard"` |
| UX best practices | `ux` | `--domain ux "animation accessibility"` |
| Alternative fonts | `typography` | `--domain typography "elegant luxury"` |
| Landing structure | `landing` | `--domain landing "hero social-proof"` |

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines (Default: html-tailwind)

Get implementation-specific best practices. If user doesn''t specify a stack, **default to `html-tailwind`**.

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack html-tailwind
```

Available stacks: `html-tailwind`, `react`, `nextjs`, `vue`, `svelte`, `swiftui`, `react-native`, `flutter`, `shadcn`, `jetpack-compose`

---

## Search Reference

### Available Domains

| Domain | Use For | Example Keywords |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `product` | Product type recommendations | SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, healthcare, beauty, service |

| `typography` | Font pairings, Google Fonts | elegant, playful, professional, modern |
| `color` | Color palettes by product type | saas, ecommerce, healthcare, beauty, fintech, service |
| `landing` | Page structure, CTA strategies | hero, hero-centric, testimonial, pricing, social-proof |
| `chart` | Chart types, library recommendations | trend, comparison, timeline, funnel, pie |
| `ux` | Best practices, anti-patterns | animation, accessibility, z-index, loading |
| `react` | React/Next.js performance | waterfall, bundle, suspense, memo, rerender, cache |
| `web` | Web interface guidelines | aria, focus, keyboard, semantic, virtualize |
| `prompt` | AI prompts, CSS keywords | (style name) |

### Available Stacks

| Stack | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `html-tailwind` | Tailwind utilities, responsive, a11y (DEFAULT) |
| `react` | State, hooks, performance, patterns |
| `nextjs` | SSR, routing, images, API routes |
| `vue` | Composition API, Pinia, Vue Router |
| `svelte` | Runes, stores, SvelteKit |
| `swiftui` | Views, State, Navigation, Animation |
| `react-native` | Components, Navigation, Lists |
| `flutter` | Widgets, State, Layout, Theming |
| `shadcn` | shadcn/ui components, theming, forms, patterns |
| `jetpack-compose` | Composables, Modifiers, State Hoisting, Recomposition |

---

## Example Workflow

**User request:** "Làm landing page cho dịch vụ chăm sóc da chuyên nghiệp"

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements
- Product type: Beauty/Spa service
- Style keywords: elegant, professional, soft
- Industry: Beauty/Wellness
- Stack: html-tailwind (default)

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "beauty spa wellness service elegant" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```

**Output:** Complete design system with pattern, style, colors, typography, effects, and anti-patterns.

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

```bash
# Get UX guidelines for animation and accessibility
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "animation accessibility" --domain ux

# Get alternative typography options if needed
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "elegant luxury serif" --domain typography
```

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "layout responsive form" --stack html-tailwind
```

**Then:** Synthesize design system + detailed searches and implement the design.

---

## Output Formats

The `--design-system` flag supports two output formats:

```bash
# ASCII box (default) - best for terminal display
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system

# Markdown - best for documentation
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system -f markdown
```

---

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific with keywords** - "healthcare SaaS dashboard" > "app"
2. **Search multiple times** - Different keywords reveal different insights
3. **Combine domains** - Style + Typography + Color = Complete design system
4. **Always check UX** - Search "animation", "z-index", "accessibility" for common issues
5. **Use stack flag** - Get implementation-specific best practices
6. **Iterate** - If first search doesn''t match, try different keywords

---

## Common Rules for Professional UI

These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional:

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule | Do | Don''t |
|------|----|----- |
| **No emoji icons** | Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons) | Use emojis like 🎨 🚀 ⚙️ as UI icons |
| **Stable hover states** | Use color/opacity transitions on hover | Use scale transforms that shift layout |
| **Correct brand logos** | Research official SVG from Simple Icons | Guess or use incorrect logo paths |
| **Consistent icon sizing** | Use fixed viewBox (24x24) with w-6 h-6 | Mix different icon sizes randomly |

### Interaction & Cursor

| Rule | Do | Don''t |
|------|----|----- |
| **Cursor pointer** | Add `cursor-pointer` to all clickable/hoverable cards | Leave default cursor on interactive elements |
| **Hover feedback** | Provide visual feedback (color, shadow, border) | No indication element is interactive |
| **Smooth transitions** | Use `transition-colors duration-200` | Instant state changes or too slow (>500ms) |

### Light/Dark Mode Contrast

| Rule | Do | Don''t |
|------|----|----- |
| **Glass card light mode** | Use `bg-white/80` or higher opacity | Use `bg-white/10` (too transparent) |
| **Text contrast light** | Use `#0F172A` (slate-900) for text | Use `#94A3B8` (slate-400) for body text |
| **Muted text light** | Use `#475569` (slate-600) minimum | Use gray-400 or lighter |
| **Border visibility** | Use `border-gray-200` in light mode | Use `border-white/10` (invisible) |

### Layout & Spacing

| Rule | Do | Don''t |
|------|----|----- |
| **Floating navbar** | Add `top-4 left-4 right-4` spacing | Stick navbar to `top-0 left-0 right-0` |
| **Content padding** | Account for fixed navbar height | Let content hide behind fixed elements |
| **Consistent max-width** | Use same `max-w-6xl` or `max-w-7xl` | Mix different container widths |

---

# Writing Skills

## Overview

**Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

**Personal skills live in agent-specific directories (`~/.claude/skills` for Claude Code, `~/.codex/skills` for Codex)** 

You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

**Core principle:** If you didn''t watch an agent fail without the skill, you don''t know if the skill teaches the right thing.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:test-driven-development before using this skill. That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.

**Official guidance:** For Anthropic''s official skill authoring best practices, see anthropic-best-practices.md. This document provides additional patterns and guidelines that complement the TDD-focused approach in this skill.

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides

**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once

## TDD Mapping for Skills

| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |
| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |
| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |
| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |
| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |
| **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill |
| **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses |
| **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations |
| **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies |
| **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify |

The entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

## When to Create a Skill

**Create when:**
- Technique wasn''t intuitively obvious to you
- You''d reference this again across projects
- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)
- Others would benefit

**Don''t create for:**
- One-off solutions
- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere
- Project-specific conventions (put in CLAUDE.md)
- Mechanical constraints (if it''s enforceable with regex/validation, automate it—save documentation for judgment calls)

## Skill Types

### Technique
Concrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)

### Pattern
Way of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)

### Reference
API docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs)

## Directory Structure


```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)
    supporting-file.*     # Only if needed
```

**Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable namespace

**Separate files for:**
1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax
2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates

**Keep inline:**
- Principles and concepts
- Code patterns (< 50 lines)
- Everything else

## SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter (YAML):**
- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`
- Max 1024 characters total
- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no parentheses, special chars)
- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)
  - Start with "Use when..." to focus on triggering conditions
  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts
  - **NEVER summarize the skill''s process or workflow** (see CSO section for why)
  - Keep under 500 characters if possible

## Claude Search Optimization (CSO)

**Critical for discovery:** Future Claude needs to FIND your skill

### 1. Rich Description Field

**Purpose:** Claude reads description to decide which skills to load for a given task. Make it answer: "Should I read this skill right now?"

**Format:** Start with "Use when..." to focus on triggering conditions

**CRITICAL: Description = When to Use, NOT What the Skill Does**

The description should ONLY describe triggering conditions. Do NOT summarize the skill''s process or workflow in the description.

**Why this matters:** Testing revealed that when a description summarizes the skill''s workflow, Claude may follow the description instead of reading the full skill content. A description saying "code review between tasks" caused Claude to do ONE review, even though the skill''s flowchart clearly showed TWO reviews (spec compliance then code quality).

When the description was changed to just "Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks" (no workflow summary), Claude correctly read the flowchart and followed the two-stage review process.

**The trap:** Descriptions that summarize workflow create a shortcut Claude will take. The skill body becomes documentation Claude skips.

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Summarizes workflow - Claude may follow this instead of reading skill
description: Use when executing plans - dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks

# ❌ BAD: Too much process detail
description: Use for TDD - write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code, refactor

# ✅ GOOD: Just triggering conditions, no workflow summary
description: Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session

# ✅ GOOD: Triggering conditions only
description: Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code
```

**Content:**
- Use concrete triggers, symptoms, and situations that signal this skill applies
- Describe the *problem* (race conditions, inconsistent behavior) not *language-specific symptoms* (setTimeout, sleep)
- Keep triggers technology-agnostic unless the skill itself is technology-specific
- If skill is technology-specific, make that explicit in the trigger
- Write in third person (injected into system prompt)
- **NEVER summarize the skill''s process or workflow**

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Too abstract, vague, doesn''t include when to use
description: For async testing

# ❌ BAD: First person
description: I can help you with async tests when they''re flaky

# ❌ BAD: Mentions technology but skill isn''t specific to it
description: Use when tests use setTimeout/sleep and are flaky

# ✅ GOOD: Starts with "Use when", describes problem, no workflow
description: Use when tests have race conditions, timing dependencies, or pass/fail inconsistently

# ✅ GOOD: Technology-specific skill with explicit trigger
description: Use when using React Router and handling authentication redirects
```

### 2. Keyword Coverage

Use words Claude would search for:
- Error messages: "Hook timed out", "ENOTEMPTY", "race condition"
- Symptoms: "flaky", "hanging", "zombie", "pollution"
- Synonyms: "timeout/hang/freeze", "cleanup/teardown/afterEach"
- Tools: Actual commands, library names, file types

### 3. Descriptive Naming

**Use active voice, verb-first:**
- ✅ `creating-skills` not `skill-creation`
- ✅ `condition-based-waiting` not `async-test-helpers`

### 4. Token Efficiency (Critical)

**Problem:** getting-started and frequently-referenced skills load into EVERY conversation. Every token counts.

**Target word counts:**
- getting-started workflows: <150 words each
- Frequently-loaded skills: <200 words total
- Other skills: <500 words (still be concise)

**Techniques:**

**Move details to tool help:**
```bash
# ❌ BAD: Document all flags in SKILL.md
search-conversations supports --text, --both, --after DATE, --before DATE, --limit N

# ✅ GOOD: Reference --help
search-conversations supports multiple modes and filters. Run --help for details.
```

**Use cross-references:**
```markdown
# ❌ BAD: Repeat workflow details
When searching, dispatch subagent with template...
[20 lines of repeated instructions]

# ✅ GOOD: Reference other skill
Always use subagents (50-100x context savings). REQUIRED: Use [other-skill-name] for workflow.
```

**Compress examples:**
```markdown
# ❌ BAD: Verbose example (42 words)
your human partner: "How did we handle authentication errors in React Router before?"
You: I''ll search past conversations for React Router authentication patterns.
[Dispatch subagent with search query: "React Router authentication error handling 401"]

# ✅ GOOD: Minimal example (20 words)
Partner: "How did we handle auth errors in React Router?"
You: Searching...
[Dispatch subagent → synthesis]
```

**Eliminate redundancy:**
- Don''t repeat what''s in cross-referenced skills
- Don''t explain what''s obvious from command
- Don''t include multiple examples of same pattern

**Verification:**
```bash
wc -w skills/path/SKILL.md
# getting-started workflows: aim for <150 each
# Other frequently-loaded: aim for <200 total
```

**Name by what you DO or core insight:**
- ✅ `condition-based-waiting` > `async-test-helpers`
- ✅ `using-skills` not `skill-usage`
- ✅ `flatten-with-flags` > `data-structure-refactoring`
- ✅ `root-cause-tracing` > `debugging-techniques`

**Gerunds (-ing) work well for processes:**
- `creating-skills`, `testing-skills`, `debugging-with-logs`
- Active, describes the action you''re taking

### 4. Cross-Referencing Other Skills

**When writing documentation that references other skills:**

Use skill name only, with explicit requirement markers:
- ✅ Good: `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:test-driven-development`
- ✅ Good: `**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:systematic-debugging`
- ❌ Bad: `See skills/testing/test-driven-development` (unclear if required)
- ❌ Bad: `@skills/testing/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` (force-loads, burns context)

**Why no @ links:** `@` syntax force-loads files immediately, consuming 200k+ context before you need them.

## Flowchart Usage

```dot
digraph when_flowchart {
    "Need to show information?" [shape=diamond];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" [shape=diamond];
    "Use markdown" [shape=box];
    "Small inline flowchart" [shape=box];

    "Need to show information?" -> "Decision where I might go wrong?" [label="yes"];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" -> "Small inline flowchart" [label="yes"];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" -> "Use markdown" [label="no"];
}
```

**Use flowcharts ONLY for:**
- Non-obvious decision points
- Process loops where you might stop too early
- "When to use A vs B" decisions

**Never use flowcharts for:**
- Reference material → Tables, lists
- Code examples → Markdown blocks
- Linear instructions → Numbered lists
- Labels without semantic meaning (step1, helper2)

See @graphviz-conventions.dot for graphviz style rules.

**Visualizing for your human partner:** Use `render-graphs.js` in this directory to render a skill''s flowcharts to SVG:
```bash
./render-graphs.js ../some-skill           # Each diagram separately
./render-graphs.js ../some-skill --combine # All diagrams in one SVG
```

## Code Examples

**One excellent example beats many mediocre ones**

Choose most relevant language:
- Testing techniques → TypeScript/JavaScript
- System debugging → Shell/Python
- Data processing → Python

**Good example:**
- Complete and runnable
- Well-commented explaining WHY
- From real scenario
- Shows pattern clearly
- Ready to adapt (not generic template)

**Don''t:**
- Implement in 5+ languages
- Create fill-in-the-blank templates
- Write contrived examples

You''re good at porting - one great example is enough.

## File Organization

### Self-Contained Skill
```
defense-in-depth/
  SKILL.md    # Everything inline
```
When: All content fits, no heavy reference needed

### Skill with Reusable Tool
```
condition-based-waiting/
  SKILL.md    # Overview + patterns
  example.ts  # Working helpers to adapt
```
When: Tool is reusable code, not just narrative

### Skill with Heavy Reference
```
pptx/
  SKILL.md       # Overview + workflows
  pptxgenjs.md   # 600 lines API reference
  ooxml.md       # 500 lines XML structure
  scripts/       # Executable tools
```
When: Reference material too large for inline

## The Iron Law (Same as TDD)

```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

This applies to NEW skills AND EDITS to existing skills.

Write skill before testing? Delete it. Start over.
Edit skill without testing? Same violation.

**No exceptions:**
- Not for "simple additions"
- Not for "just adding a section"
- Not for "documentation updates"
- Don''t keep untested changes as "reference"
- Don''t "adapt" while running tests
- Delete means delete

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** The superpowers:test-driven-development skill explains why this matters. Same principles apply to documentation.

## Testing All Skill Types

Different skill types need different test approaches:

### Discipline-Enforcing Skills (rules/requirements)

**Examples:** TDD, verification-before-completion, designing-before-coding

**Test with:**
- Academic questions: Do they understand the rules?
- Pressure scenarios: Do they comply under stress?
- Multiple pressures combined: time + sunk cost + exhaustion
- Identify rationalizations and add explicit counters

**Success criteria:** Agent follows rule under maximum pressure

### Technique Skills (how-to guides)

**Examples:** condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing, defensive-programming

**Test with:**
- Application scenarios: Can they apply the technique correctly?
- Variation scenarios: Do they handle edge cases?
- Missing information tests: Do instructions have gaps?

**Success criteria:** Agent successfully applies technique to new scenario

### Pattern Skills (mental models)

**Examples:** reducing-complexity, information-hiding concepts

**Test with:**
- Recognition scenarios: Do they recognize when pattern applies?
- Application scenarios: Can they use the mental model?
- Counter-examples: Do they know when NOT to apply?

**Success criteria:** Agent correctly identifies when/how to apply pattern

### Reference Skills (documentation/APIs)

**Examples:** API documentation, command references, library guides

**Test with:**
- Retrieval scenarios: Can they find the right information?
- Application scenarios: Can they use what they found correctly?
- Gap testing: Are common use cases covered?

**Success criteria:** Agent finds and correctly applies reference information

## Common Rationalizations for Skipping Testing

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Skill is obviously clear" | Clear to you ≠ clear to other agents. Test it. |
| "It''s just a reference" | References can have gaps, unclear sections. Test retrieval. |
| "Testing is overkill" | Untested skills have issues. Always. 15 min testing saves hours. |
| "I''ll test if problems emerge" | Problems = agents can''t use skill. Test BEFORE deploying. |
| "Too tedious to test" | Testing is less tedious than debugging bad skill in production. |
| "I''m confident it''s good" | Overconfidence guarantees issues. Test anyway. |
| "Academic review is enough" | Reading ≠ using. Test application scenarios. |
| "No time to test" | Deploying untested skill wastes more time fixing it later. |

**All of these mean: Test before deploying. No exceptions.**

## Bulletproofing Skills Against Rationalization

Skills that enforce discipline (like TDD) need to resist rationalization. Agents are smart and will find loopholes when under pressure.

**Psychology note:** Understanding WHY persuasion techniques work helps you apply them systematically. See persuasion-principles.md for research foundation (Cialdini, 2021; Meincke et al., 2025) on authority, commitment, scarcity, social proof, and unity principles.

### Close Every Loophole Explicitly

Don''t just state the rule - forbid specific workarounds:

<Bad>
```markdown
Write code before test? Delete it.
```
</Bad>

<Good>
```markdown
Write code before test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don''t keep it as "reference"
- Don''t "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don''t look at it
- Delete means delete
```
</Good>

### Address "Spirit vs Letter" Arguments

Add foundational principle early:

```markdown
**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**
```

This cuts off entire class of "I''m following the spirit" rationalizations.

### Build Rationalization Table

Capture rationalizations from baseline testing (see Testing section below). Every excuse agents make goes in the table:

```markdown
| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I''ll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Tests after achieve same goals" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |
```

### Create Red Flags List

Make it easy for agents to self-check when rationalizing:

```markdown
## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "It''s about spirit not ritual"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**
```

### Update CSO for Violation Symptoms

Add to description: symptoms of when you''re ABOUT to violate the rule:

```yaml
description: use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code
```

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills

Follow the TDD cycle:

### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline)

Run pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior:
- What choices did they make?
- What rationalizations did they use (verbatim)?
- Which pressures triggered violations?

This is "watch the test fail" - you must see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.

### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill

Write skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Don''t add extra content for hypothetical cases.

Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.

### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes

Agent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof.

**Testing methodology:** See @testing-skills-with-subagents.md for the complete testing methodology:
- How to write pressure scenarios
- Pressure types (time, sunk cost, authority, exhaustion)
- Plugging holes systematically
- Meta-testing techniques

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Narrative Example
"In session 2025-10-03, we found empty projectDir caused..."
**Why bad:** Too specific, not reusable

### ❌ Multi-Language Dilution
example-js.js, example-py.py, example-go.go
**Why bad:** Mediocre quality, maintenance burden

### ❌ Code in Flowcharts
```dot
step1 [label="import fs"];
step2 [label="read file"];
```
**Why bad:** Can''t copy-paste, hard to read

### ❌ Generic Labels
helper1, helper2, step3, pattern4
**Why bad:** Labels should have semantic meaning

## STOP: Before Moving to Next Skill

**After writing ANY skill, you MUST STOP and complete the deployment process.**

**Do NOT:**
- Create multiple skills in batch without testing each
- Move to next skill before current one is verified
- Skip testing because "batching is more efficient"

**The deployment checklist below is MANDATORY for EACH skill.**

Deploying untested skills = deploying untested code. It''s a violation of quality standards.

## Skill Creation Checklist (TDD Adapted)

**IMPORTANT: Use TodoWrite to create todos for EACH checklist item below.**

**RED Phase - Write Failing Test:**
- [ ] Create pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures for discipline skills)
- [ ] Run scenarios WITHOUT skill - document baseline behavior verbatim
- [ ] Identify patterns in rationalizations/failures

**GREEN Phase - Write Minimal Skill:**
- [ ] Name uses only letters, numbers, hyphens (no parentheses/special chars)
- [ ] YAML frontmatter with only name and description (max 1024 chars)
- [ ] Description starts with "Use when..." and includes specific triggers/symptoms
- [ ] Description written in third person
- [ ] Keywords throughout for search (errors, symptoms, tools)
- [ ] Clear overview with core principle
- [ ] Address specific baseline failures identified in RED
- [ ] Code inline OR link to separate file
- [ ] One excellent example (not multi-language)
- [ ] Run scenarios WITH skill - verify agents now comply

**REFACTOR Phase - Close Loopholes:**
- [ ] Identify NEW rationalizations from testing
- [ ] Add explicit counters (if discipline skill)
- [ ] Build rationalization table from all test iterations
- [ ] Create red flags list
- [ ] Re-test until bulletproof

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] Small flowchart only if decision non-obvious
- [ ] Quick reference table
- [ ] Common mistakes section
- [ ] No narrative storytelling
- [ ] Supporting files only for tools or heavy reference

**Deployment:**
- [ ] Commit skill to git and push to your fork (if configured)
- [ ] Consider contributing back via PR (if broadly useful)

## Discovery Workflow

How future Claude finds your skill:

1. **Encounters problem** ("tests are flaky")
3. **Finds SKILL** (description matches)
4. **Scans overview** (is this relevant?)
5. **Reads patterns** (quick reference table)
6. **Loads example** (only when implementing)

**Optimize for this flow** - put searchable terms early and often.

## The Bottom Line

**Creating skills IS TDD for process documentation.**

Same Iron Law: No skill without failing test first.
Same cycle: RED (baseline) → GREEN (write skill) → REFACTOR (close loopholes).
Same benefits: Better quality, fewer surprises, bulletproof results.

If you follow TDD for code, follow it for skills. It''s the same discipline applied to documentation.

# Requirements for Outputs

## All Excel files

### Zero Formula Errors
- Every Excel model MUST be delivered with ZERO formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?)

### Preserve Existing Templates (when updating templates)
- Study and EXACTLY match existing format, style, and conventions when modifying files
- Never impose standardized formatting on files with established patterns
- Existing template conventions ALWAYS override these guidelines

## Financial models

### Color Coding Standards
Unless otherwise stated by the user or existing template

#### Industry-Standard Color Conventions
- **Blue text (RGB: 0,0,255)**: Hardcoded inputs, and numbers users will change for scenarios
- **Black text (RGB: 0,0,0)**: ALL formulas and calculations
- **Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)**: Links pulling from other worksheets within same workbook
- **Red text (RGB: 255,0,0)**: External links to other files
- **Yellow background (RGB: 255,255,0)**: Key assumptions needing attention or cells that need to be updated

### Number Formatting Standards

#### Required Format Rules
- **Years**: Format as text strings (e.g., "2024" not "2,024")
- **Currency**: Use $#,##0 format; ALWAYS specify units in headers ("Revenue ($mm)")
- **Zeros**: Use number formatting to make all zeros "-", including percentages (e.g., "$#,##0;($#,##0);-")
- **Percentages**: Default to 0.0% format (one decimal)
- **Multiples**: Format as 0.0x for valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E)
- **Negative numbers**: Use parentheses (123) not minus -123

### Formula Construction Rules

#### Assumptions Placement
- Place ALL assumptions (growth rates, margins, multiples, etc.) in separate assumption cells
- Use cell references instead of hardcoded values in formulas
- Example: Use =B5*(1+$B$6) instead of =B5*1.05

#### Formula Error Prevention
- Verify all cell references are correct
- Check for off-by-one errors in ranges
- Ensure consistent formulas across all projection periods
- Test with edge cases (zero values, negative numbers)
- Verify no unintended circular references

#### Documentation Requirements for Hardcodes
- Comment or in cells beside (if end of table). Format: "Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Specific Reference], [URL if applicable]"
- Examples:
  - "Source: Company 10-K, FY2024, Page 45, Revenue Note, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Company 10-Q, Q2 2025, Exhibit 99.1, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Bloomberg Terminal, 8/15/2025, AAPL US Equity"
  - "Source: FactSet, 8/20/2025, Consensus Estimates Screen"

# XLSX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of an .xlsx file. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

## Important Requirements

**LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the `recalc.py` script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run

## Reading and analyzing data

### Data analysis with pandas
For data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read Excel
df = pd.read_excel(''file.xlsx'')  # Default: first sheet
all_sheets = pd.read_excel(''file.xlsx'', sheet_name=None)  # All sheets as dict

# Analyze
df.head()      # Preview data
df.info()      # Column info
df.describe()  # Statistics

# Write Excel
df.to_excel(''output.xlsx'', index=False)
```

## Excel File Workflows

## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values

**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.

### ❌ WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values
```python
# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result
total = df[''Sales''].sum()
sheet[''B10''] = total  # Hardcodes 5000

# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python
growth = (df.iloc[-1][''Revenue''] - df.iloc[0][''Revenue'']) / df.iloc[0][''Revenue'']
sheet[''C5''] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15

# Bad: Python calculation for average
avg = sum(values) / len(values)
sheet[''D20''] = avg  # Hardcodes 42.5
```

### ✅ CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas
```python
# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum
sheet[''B10''] = ''=SUM(B2:B9)''

# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula
sheet[''C5''] = ''=(C4-C2)/C2''

# Good: Average using Excel function
sheet[''D20''] = ''=AVERAGE(D2:D19)''
```

This applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes.

## Common Workflow
1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting
2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file
3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting
4. **Save**: Write to file
5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the recalc.py script
   ```bash
   python recalc.py output.xlsx
   ```
6. **Verify and fix any errors**: 
   - The script returns JSON with error details
   - If `status` is `errors_found`, check `error_summary` for specific error types and locations
   - Fix the identified errors and recalculate again
   - Common errors to fix:
     - `#REF!`: Invalid cell references
     - `#DIV/0!`: Division by zero
     - `#VALUE!`: Wrong data type in formula
     - `#NAME?`: Unrecognized formula name

### Creating new Excel files

```python
# Using openpyxl for formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment

wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active

# Add data
sheet[''A1''] = ''Hello''
sheet[''B1''] = ''World''
sheet.append([''Row'', ''of'', ''data''])

# Add formula
sheet[''B2''] = ''=SUM(A1:A10)''

# Formatting
sheet[''A1''].font = Font(bold=True, color=''FF0000'')
sheet[''A1''].fill = PatternFill(''solid'', start_color=''FFFF00'')
sheet[''A1''].alignment = Alignment(horizontal=''center'')

# Column width
sheet.column_dimensions[''A''].width = 20

wb.save(''output.xlsx'')
```

### Editing existing Excel files

```python
# Using openpyxl to preserve formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load existing file
wb = load_workbook(''existing.xlsx'')
sheet = wb.active  # or wb[''SheetName''] for specific sheet

# Working with multiple sheets
for sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:
    sheet = wb[sheet_name]
    print(f"Sheet: {sheet_name}")

# Modify cells
sheet[''A1''] = ''New Value''
sheet.insert_rows(2)  # Insert row at position 2
sheet.delete_cols(3)  # Delete column 3

# Add new sheet
new_sheet = wb.create_sheet(''NewSheet'')
new_sheet[''A1''] = ''Data''

wb.save(''modified.xlsx'')
```

## Recalculating formulas

Excel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided `recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:

```bash
python recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]
```

Example:
```bash
python recalc.py output.xlsx 30
```

The script:
- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run
- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets
- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)
- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts
- Works on both Linux and macOS

## Formula Verification Checklist

Quick checks to ensure formulas work correctly:

### Essential Verification
- [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model
- [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK)
- [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6)

### Common Pitfalls
- [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with `pd.notna()`
- [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+ 
- [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first
- [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using `/` in formulas (#DIV/0!)
- [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!)
- [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets

### Formula Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly
- [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values

### Interpreting recalc.py Output
The script returns JSON with error details:
```json
{
  "status": "success",           // or "errors_found"
  "total_errors": 0,              // Total error count
  "total_formulas": 42,           // Number of formulas in file
  "error_summary": {              // Only present if errors found
    "#REF!": {
      "count": 2,
      "locations": ["Sheet1!B5", "Sheet1!C10"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Library Selection
- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export
- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features

### Working with openpyxl
- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)
- Use `data_only=True` to read calculated values: `load_workbook(''file.xlsx'', data_only=True)`
- **Warning**: If opened with `data_only=True` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost
- For large files: Use `read_only=True` for reading or `write_only=True` for writing
- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use recalc.py to update values

### Working with pandas
- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: `pd.read_excel(''file.xlsx'', dtype={''id'': str})`
- For large files, read specific columns: `pd.read_excel(''file.xlsx'', usecols=[''A'', ''C'', ''E''])`
- Handle dates properly: `pd.read_excel(''file.xlsx'', parse_dates=[''date_column''])`

## Code Style Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:
- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments
- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations
- Avoid unnecessary print statements

**For Excel files themselves**:
- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions
- Document data sources for hardcoded values
- Include notes for key calculations and model sections', '{"name": "xlsx", "description": "Comprehensive spreadsheet creation, editing, and analysis with support for formulas, formatting, data analysis, and visualization.
