# Paywall and Upgrade Screen CRO

You are an expert in in-app paywalls and upgrade flows. Your goal is to convert free users to paid, or upgrade users to higher tiers, at moments when they''ve experienced enough value to justify the commitment.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Upgrade Context**
   - Freemium → Paid conversion
   - Trial → Paid conversion
   - Tier upgrade (Basic → Pro)
   - Feature-specific upsell
   - Usage limit upsell

2. **Product Model**
   - What''s free forever?
   - What''s behind the paywall?
   - What triggers upgrade prompts?
   - What''s the current conversion rate?

3. **User Journey**
   - At what point does this appear?
   - What have they experienced already?
   - What are they trying to do when blocked?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Value Before Ask
- User should have experienced real value first
- The upgrade should feel like a natural next step
- Timing: After "aha moment," not before

### 2. Show, Don''t Just Tell
- Demonstrate the value of paid features
- Preview what they''re missing
- Make the upgrade feel tangible

### 3. Friction-Free Path
- Easy to upgrade when ready
- Don''t make them hunt for pricing
- Remove barriers to conversion

### 4. Respect the No
- Don''t trap or pressure
- Make it easy to continue free
- Maintain trust for future conversion

---

## Paywall Trigger Points

### Feature Gates
When user clicks a paid-only feature:
- Clear explanation of why it''s paid
- Show what the feature does
- Quick path to unlock
- Option to continue without

### Usage Limits
When user hits a limit:
- Clear indication of what limit was reached
- Show what upgrading provides
- Option to buy more without full upgrade
- Don''t block abruptly

### Trial Expiration
When trial is ending:
- Early warnings (7 days, 3 days, 1 day)
- Clear "what happens" on expiration
- Easy re-activation if expired
- Summarize value received

### Time-Based Prompts
After X days/sessions of free use:
- Gentle upgrade reminder
- Highlight unused paid features
- Not intrusive—banner or subtle modal
- Easy to dismiss

### Context-Triggered
When behavior indicates upgrade fit:
- Power users who''d benefit
- Teams using solo features
- Heavy usage approaching limits
- Inviting teammates

---

## Paywall Screen Components

### 1. Headline
Focus on what they get, not what they pay:
- "Unlock [Feature] to [Benefit]"
- "Get more [value] with [Plan]"
- Not: "Upgrade to Pro for $X/month"

### 2. Value Demonstration
Show what they''re missing:
- Preview of the feature in action
- Before/after comparison
- "With Pro, you could..." examples
- Specific to their use case if possible

### 3. Feature Comparison
If showing tiers:
- Highlight key differences
- Current plan clearly marked
- Recommended plan emphasized
- Focus on outcomes, not feature lists

### 4. Pricing
- Clear, simple pricing
- Annual vs. monthly options
- Per-seat clarity if applicable
- Any trials or guarantees

### 5. Social Proof (Optional)
- Customer quotes about the upgrade
- "X teams use this feature"
- Success metrics from upgraded users

### 6. CTA
- Specific: "Upgrade to Pro" not "Upgrade"
- Value-oriented: "Start Getting [Benefit]"
- If trial: "Start Free Trial"

### 7. Escape Hatch
- Clear "Not now" or "Continue with Free"
- Don''t make them feel bad
- "Maybe later" vs. "No, I''ll stay limited"

---

## Specific Paywall Types

# PDF Processing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers essential PDF processing operations using Python libraries and command-line tools. For advanced features, JavaScript libraries, and detailed examples, see reference.md. If you need to fill out a PDF form, read forms.md and follow its instructions.

## Quick Start

```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

# Read a PDF
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
print(f"Pages: {len(reader.pages)}")

# Extract text
text = ""
for page in reader.pages:
    text += page.extract_text()
```

## Python Libraries

### pypdf - Basic Operations

#### Merge PDFs
```python
from pypdf import PdfWriter, PdfReader

writer = PdfWriter()
for pdf_file in ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf", "doc3.pdf"]:
    reader = PdfReader(pdf_file)
    for page in reader.pages:
        writer.add_page(page)

with open("merged.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
```

#### Split PDF
```python
reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
for i, page in enumerate(reader.pages):
    writer = PdfWriter()
    writer.add_page(page)
    with open(f"page_{i+1}.pdf", "wb") as output:
        writer.write(output)
```

#### Extract Metadata
```python
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
meta = reader.metadata
print(f"Title: {meta.title}")
print(f"Author: {meta.author}")
print(f"Subject: {meta.subject}")
print(f"Creator: {meta.creator}")
```

#### Rotate Pages
```python
reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

page = reader.pages[0]
page.rotate(90)  # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
writer.add_page(page)

with open("rotated.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
```

### pdfplumber - Text and Table Extraction

#### Extract Text with Layout
```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    for page in pdf.pages:
        text = page.extract_text()
        print(text)
```

#### Extract Tables
```python
with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        for j, table in enumerate(tables):
            print(f"Table {j+1} on page {i+1}:")
            for row in table:
                print(row)
```

#### Advanced Table Extraction
```python
import pandas as pd

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    all_tables = []
    for page in pdf.pages:
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        for table in tables:
            if table:  # Check if table is not empty
                df = pd.DataFrame(table[1:], columns=table[0])
                all_tables.append(df)

# Combine all tables
if all_tables:
    combined_df = pd.concat(all_tables, ignore_index=True)
    combined_df.to_excel("extracted_tables.xlsx", index=False)
```

### reportlab - Create PDFs

#### Basic PDF Creation
```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas

c = canvas.Canvas("hello.pdf", pagesize=letter)
width, height = letter

# Add text
c.drawString(100, height - 100, "Hello World!")
c.drawString(100, height - 120, "This is a PDF created with reportlab")

# Add a line
c.line(100, height - 140, 400, height - 140)

# Save
c.save()
```

#### Create PDF with Multiple Pages
```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Spacer, PageBreak
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet

doc = SimpleDocTemplate("report.pdf", pagesize=letter)
styles = getSampleStyleSheet()
story = []

# Add content
title = Paragraph("Report Title", styles[''Title''])
story.append(title)
story.append(Spacer(1, 12))

body = Paragraph("This is the body of the report. " * 20, styles[''Normal''])
story.append(body)
story.append(PageBreak())

# Page 2
story.append(Paragraph("Page 2", styles[''Heading1'']))
story.append(Paragraph("Content for page 2", styles[''Normal'']))

# Build PDF
doc.build(story)
```

## Command-Line Tools

### pdftotext (poppler-utils)
```bash
# Extract text
pdftotext input.pdf output.txt

# Extract text preserving layout
pdftotext -layout input.pdf output.txt

# Extract specific pages
pdftotext -f 1 -l 5 input.pdf output.txt  # Pages 1-5
```

### qpdf
```bash
# Merge PDFs
qpdf --empty --pages file1.pdf file2.pdf -- merged.pdf

# Split pages
qpdf input.pdf --pages . 1-5 -- pages1-5.pdf
qpdf input.pdf --pages . 6-10 -- pages6-10.pdf

# Rotate pages
qpdf input.pdf output.pdf --rotate=+90:1  # Rotate page 1 by 90 degrees

# Remove password
qpdf --password=mypassword --decrypt encrypted.pdf decrypted.pdf
```

### pdftk (if available)
```bash
# Merge
pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf cat output merged.pdf

```

## Common Tasks

### Extract Text from Scanned PDFs
```python
# Requires: pip install pytesseract pdf2image
import pytesseract
from pdf2image import convert_from_path

# Convert PDF to images
images = convert_from_path(''scanned.pdf'')

# OCR each page
text = ""
for i, image in enumerate(images):
    text += f"Page {i+1}:\n"
    text += pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    text += "\n\n"

print(text)
```

### Add Watermark
```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

# Create watermark (or load existing)
watermark = PdfReader("watermark.pdf").pages[0]

# Apply to all pages
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

for page in reader.pages:
    page.merge_page(watermark)
    writer.add_page(page)

with open("watermarked.pdf", "wb") as output:
    writer.write(output)
```

### Extract Images
```bash
# Using pdfimages (poppler-utils)
pdfimages -j input.pdf output_prefix

# This extracts all images as output_prefix-000.jpg, output_prefix-001.jpg, etc.
```

### Password Protection
```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

for page in reader.pages:

# Popup CRO

You are an expert in popup and modal optimization. Your goal is to create popups that convert without annoying users or damaging brand perception.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Popup Purpose**
   - Email/newsletter capture
   - Lead magnet delivery
   - Discount/promotion
   - Announcement
   - Exit intent save
   - Feature promotion
   - Feedback/survey

2. **Current State**
   - Existing popup performance?
   - What triggers are used?
   - User complaints or feedback?
   - Mobile experience?

3. **Traffic Context**
   - Traffic sources (paid, organic, direct)
   - New vs. returning visitors
   - Page types where shown

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Timing Is Everything
- Too early = annoying interruption
- Too late = missed opportunity
- Right time = helpful offer at moment of need

### 2. Value Must Be Obvious
- Clear, immediate benefit
- Relevant to page context
- Worth the interruption

### 3. Respect the User
- Easy to dismiss
- Don''t trap or trick
- Remember preferences
- Don''t ruin the experience

---

## Trigger Strategies

### Time-Based
- **Not recommended**: "Show after 5 seconds"
- **Better**: "Show after 30-60 seconds" (proven engagement)
- Best for: General site visitors

### Scroll-Based
- **Typical**: 25-50% scroll depth
- Indicates: Content engagement
- Best for: Blog posts, long-form content
- Example: "You''re halfway through—get more like this"

### Exit Intent
- Detects cursor moving to close/leave
- Last chance to capture value
- Best for: E-commerce, lead gen
- Mobile alternative: Back button or scroll up

### Click-Triggered
- User initiates (clicks button/link)
- Zero annoyance factor
- Best for: Lead magnets, gated content, demos
- Example: "Download PDF" → Popup form

### Page Count / Session-Based
- After visiting X pages
- Indicates research/comparison behavior
- Best for: Multi-page journeys
- Example: "Been comparing? Here''s a summary..."

### Behavior-Based
- Add to cart abandonment
- Pricing page visitors
- Repeat page visits
- Best for: High-intent segments

---

## Popup Types

### Email Capture Popup
**Goal**: Newsletter/list subscription

**Best practices:**
- Clear value prop (not just "Subscribe")
- Specific benefit of subscribing
- Single field (email only)
- Consider incentive (discount, content)

**Copy structure:**
- Headline: Benefit or curiosity hook
- Subhead: What they get, how often
- CTA: Specific action ("Get Weekly Tips")

### Lead Magnet Popup
**Goal**: Exchange content for email

**Best practices:**
- Show what they get (cover image, preview)
- Specific, tangible promise
- Minimal fields (email, maybe name)
- Instant delivery expectation

### Discount/Promotion Popup
**Goal**: First purchase or conversion

**Best practices:**
- Clear discount (10%, $20, free shipping)
- Deadline creates urgency
- Single use per visitor
- Easy to apply code

### Exit Intent Popup
**Goal**: Last-chance conversion

**Best practices:**
- Acknowledge they''re leaving
- Different offer than entry popup
- Address common objections
- Final compelling reason to stay

**Formats:**
- "Wait! Before you go..."
- "Forget something?"
- "Get 10% off your first order"
- "Questions? Chat with us"

### Announcement Banner
**Goal**: Site-wide communication

**Best practices:**
- Top of page (sticky or static)
- Single, clear message
- Dismissable
- Links to more info
- Time-limited (don''t leave forever)

### Slide-In
**Goal**: Less intrusive engagement

**Best practices:**
- Enters from corner/bottom
- Doesn''t block content
- Easy to dismiss or minimize
- Good for chat, support, secondary CTAs

---

## Design Best Practices

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Headline (largest, first seen)
2. Value prop/offer (clear benefit)
3. Form/CTA (obvious action)
4. Close option (easy to find)

### Sizing
- Desktop: 400-600px wide typical
- Don''t cover entire screen
- Mobile: Full-width bottom or center, not full-screen
- Leave space to close (visible X, click outside)

### Close Button
- Always visible (top right is convention)
- Large enough to tap on mobile
- "No thanks" text link as alternative
- Click outside to close

### Mobile Considerations
- Can''t detect exit intent (use alternatives)
- Full-screen overlays feel aggressive
- Bottom slide-ups work well
- Larger touch targets
- Easy dismiss gestures

### Imagery
- Product image or preview
- Face if relevant (increases trust)
- Minimal for speed
- Optional—copy can work alone

---

## Copy Formulas

### Headlines
- Benefit-driven: "Get [result] in [timeframe]"
- Question: "Want [desired outcome]?"
- Command: "Don''t miss [thing]"
- Social proof: "Join [X] people who..."
- Curiosity: "The one thing [audience] always get wrong about [topic]"

### Subheadlines
- Expand on the promise
- Address objection ("No spam, ever")
- Set expectations ("Weekly tips in 5 min")

### CTA Buttons
- First person works: "Get My Discount" vs "Get Your Discount"
- Specific over generic: "Send Me the Guide" vs "Submit"
- Value-focused: "Claim My 10% Off" vs "Subscribe"

### Decline Options
- Polite, not guilt-trippy
- "No thanks" / "Maybe later" / "I''m not interested"
- Avoid manipulative: "No, I don''t want to save money"

---

## Frequency and Rules

### Frequency Capping
- Show maximum once per session
- Remember dismissals (cookie/localStorage)
- 7-30 days before showing again
- Respect user choice

### Audience Targeting

- By traffic source (match ad message)
- By page type (context-relevant)
- Exclude converted users
- Exclude recently dismissed

### Page Rules
- Exclude checkout/conversion flows
- Consider blog vs. product pages
- Match offer to page context

---

## Compliance and Accessibility

### GDPR/Privacy

## Pricing Fundamentals

### The Three Pricing Axes

Every pricing decision involves three dimensions:

**1. Packaging** — What''s included at each tier?
- Features, limits, support level
- How tiers differ from each other

**2. Pricing Metric** — What do you charge for?
- Per user, per usage, flat fee
- How price scales with value

**3. Price Point** — How much do you charge?
- The actual dollar amounts
- The perceived value vs. cost

### Value-Based Pricing Framework

Price should be based on value delivered, not cost to serve:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│  Customer''s perceived value of your solution            │
│  ────────────────────────────────────────────── $1000   │
│                                                         │
│  ↑ Value captured (your opportunity)                    │
│                                                         │

│                                                         │
│  ↑ Consumer surplus (value customer keeps)              │
│                                                         │
│  Next best alternative                                  │
│  ────────────────────────────────────────────── $300    │
│                                                         │
│  ↑ Differentiation value                                │
│                                                         │
│  Your cost to serve                                     │
│  ────────────────────────────────────────────── $50     │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** Price between the next best alternative and perceived value. Cost is a floor, not a basis.

## Pricing Research Methods

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

The Van Westendorp survey identifies the acceptable price range for your product.

**The Four Questions:**

Ask each respondent:
1. "At what price would you consider [product] to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it?" (Too expensive)
2. "At what price would you consider [product] to be priced so low that you would question its quality?" (Too cheap)
3. "At what price would you consider [product] to be starting to get expensive, but you still might consider it?" (Expensive/high side)
4. "At what price would you consider [product] to be a bargain—a great buy for the money?" (Cheap/good value)

**How to Analyze:**

1. Plot cumulative distributions for each question
2. Find the intersections:
   - **Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC):** "Too cheap" crosses "Expensive"
   - **Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME):** "Too expensive" crosses "Cheap"
   - **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** "Too cheap" crosses "Too expensive"
   - **Indifference Price Point (IDP):** "Expensive" crosses "Cheap"

**The acceptable price range:** PMC to PME
**Optimal pricing zone:** Between OPP and IDP

**Survey Tips:**
- Need 100-300 respondents for reliable data
- Segment by persona (different willingness to pay)
- Use realistic product descriptions
- Consider adding purchase intent questions

**Sample Van Westendorp Analysis Output:**

```
Price Sensitivity Analysis Results:
─────────────────────────────────
Point of Marginal Cheapness:  $29/mo
Optimal Price Point:          $49/mo
Indifference Price Point:     $59/mo
Point of Marginal Expensiveness: $79/mo

Recommended range: $49-59/mo
Current price: $39/mo (below optimal)
Opportunity: 25-50% price increase without significant demand impact
```

### MaxDiff Analysis (Best-Worst Scaling)

MaxDiff identifies which features customers value most, informing packaging decisions.

**How It Works:**

1. List 8-15 features you could include
2. Show respondents sets of 4-5 features at a time
3. Ask: "Which is MOST important? Which is LEAST important?"
4. Repeat across multiple sets until all features compared
5. Statistical analysis produces importance scores

**Example Survey Question:**

```
Which feature is MOST important to you?
Which feature is LEAST important to you?

□ Unlimited projects
□ Custom branding
□ Priority support
□ API access
□ Advanced analytics
```

**Analyzing Results:**

Features are ranked by utility score:
- High utility = Must-have (include in base tier)
- Medium utility = Differentiator (use for tier separation)
- Low utility = Nice-to-have (premium tier or cut)

**Using MaxDiff for Packaging:**

| Utility Score | Packaging Decision |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Top 20% | Include in all tiers (table stakes) |
| 20-50% | Use to differentiate tiers |
| 50-80% | Higher tiers only |
| Bottom 20% | Consider cutting or premium add-on |

### Willingness to Pay Surveys

**Direct method (simple but biased):**
"How much would you pay for [product]?"

**Better: Gabor-Granger method:**
"Would you buy [product] at [$X]?" (Yes/No)
Vary price across respondents to build demand curve.

**Even better: Conjoint analysis:**
Show product bundles at different prices
Respondents choose preferred option
Statistical analysis reveals price sensitivity per feature

---

## Value Metrics

### What is a Value Metric?

The value metric is what you charge for—it should scale with the value customers receive.

**Good value metrics:**
- Align price with value delivered
- Are easy to understand
- Scale as customer grows
- Are hard to game

### Common Value Metrics

| Metric | Best For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Per user/seat | Collaboration tools | Slack, Notion |
| Per usage | Variable consumption | AWS, Twilio |
| Per feature | Modular products | HubSpot add-ons |
| Per contact/record | CRM, email tools | Mailchimp, HubSpot |
| Per transaction | Payments, marketplaces | Stripe, Shopify |
| Flat fee | Simple products | Basecamp |
| Revenue share | High-value outcomes | Affiliate platforms |

### Choosing Your Value Metric

**Step 1: Identify how customers get value**
- What outcome do they care about?
- What do they measure success by?
- What would they pay more for?

**Step 2: Map usage to value**

| Usage Pattern | Value Delivered | Potential Metric |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| More team members use it | More collaboration value | Per user |
| More data processed | More insights | Per record/event |
| More revenue generated | Direct ROI | Revenue share |
| More projects managed | More organization | Per project |

**Step 3: Test for alignment**

Ask: "As a customer uses more of [metric], do they get more value?"
- If yes → good value metric
- If no → price doesn''t align with value

### Mapping Usage to Value: Framework

**1. Instrument usage data**
Track how customers use your product:
- Feature usage frequency
- Volume metrics (users, records, API calls)
- Outcome metrics (revenue generated, time saved)

**2. Correlate with customer success**
- Which usage patterns predict retention?
- Which usage patterns predict expansion?
- Which customers pay the most, and why?

**3. Identify value thresholds**
- At what usage level do customers "get it"?
- At what usage level do they expand?
- At what usage level should price increase?

**Example Analysis:**

```
Usage-Value Correlation Analysis:
─────────────────────────────────
Segment: High-LTV customers (>$10k ARR)
Average monthly active users: 15
Average projects: 8
Average integrations: 4

Segment: Churned customers
Average monthly active users: 3
Average projects: 2
Average integrations: 0

Insight: Value correlates with team adoption (users)
        and depth of use (integrations)

Recommendation: Price per user, gate integrations to higher tiers
```

---

## Tier Structure

### How Many Tiers?

**2 tiers:** Simple, clear choice
- Works for: Clear SMB vs. Enterprise split
- Risk: May leave money on table

**3 tiers:** Industry standard
- Good tier = Entry point
- Better tier = Recommended (anchor to best)
- Best tier = High-value customers

**4+ tiers:** More granularity
- Works for: Wide range of customer sizes
- Risk: Decision paralysis, complexity

### Good-Better-Best Framework

**Good tier (Entry):**
- Purpose: Remove barriers to entry
- Includes: Core features, limited usage
- Price: Low, accessible
- Target: Small teams, try before you buy

**Better tier (Recommended):**
- Purpose: Where most customers land
- Includes: Full features, reasonable limits
- Price: Your "anchor" price
- Target: Growing teams, serious users

**Best tier (Premium):**
- Purpose: Capture high-value customers
- Includes: Everything, advanced features, higher limits
- Price: Premium (often 2-3x "Better")
- Target: Larger teams, power users, enterprises

### Tier Differentiation Strategies

**Feature gating:**
- Basic features in all tiers
- Advanced features in higher tiers
- Works when features have clear value differences

**Usage limits:**
- Same features, different limits
- More users, storage, API calls at higher tiers
- Works when value scales with usage

**Support level:**
- Email support → Priority support → Dedicated success
- Works for products with implementation complexity

**Access and customization:**
- API access, SSO, custom branding
- Works for enterprise differentiation

### Example Tier Structure

```
┌────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│                │ Starter         │ Pro             │ Business        │
│                │ $29/mo          │ $79/mo          │ $199/mo         │
├────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Users          │ Up to 5         │ Up to 20        │ Unlimited       │
│ Projects       │ 10              │ Unlimited       │ Unlimited       │
│ Storage        │ 5 GB            │ 50 GB           │ 500 GB          │
│ Integrations   │ 3               │ 10              │ Unlimited       │
│ Analytics      │ Basic           │ Advanced        │ Custom          │

│ Audit logs     │ ✗               │ ✗               │ ✓               │
└────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## Packaging for Personas

### Identifying Pricing Personas

Different customers have different:
- Willingness to pay
- Feature needs
- Buying processes
- Value perception

**Segment by:**
- Company size (solopreneur → SMB → enterprise)
- Use case (marketing vs. sales vs. support)
- Sophistication (beginner → power user)
- Industry (different budget norms)

### Persona-Based Packaging

**Step 1: Define personas**

| Persona | Size | Needs | WTP | Example |
|---------|------|-------|-----|---------|
| Freelancer | 1 person | Basic features | Low | $19/mo |
| Small Team | 2-10 | Collaboration | Medium | $49/mo |
| Growing Co | 10-50 | Scale, integrations | Higher | $149/mo |
| Enterprise | 50+ | Security, support | High | Custom |

**Step 2: Map features to personas**

| Feature | Freelancer | Small Team | Growing | Enterprise |
|---------|------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Core features | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Collaboration | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Integrations | — | Limited | Full | Full |
| API access | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| SSO/SAML | — | — | — | ✓ |
| Audit logs | — | — | — | ✓ |
| Custom contract | — | — | — | ✓ |

**Step 3: Price to value for each persona**
- Research willingness to pay per segment
- Set prices that capture value without blocking adoption
- Consider segment-specific landing pages

---

## Freemium vs. Free Trial

### When to Use Freemium

**Freemium works when:**
- Product has viral/network effects
- Free users provide value (content, data, referrals)
- Large market where % conversion drives volume
- Low marginal cost to serve free users
- Clear feature/usage limits for upgrade trigger

**Freemium risks:**
- Free users may never convert
- Devalues product perception
- Support costs for non-paying users
- Harder to raise prices later

**Example: Slack**
- Free tier for small teams
- Message history limit creates upgrade trigger
- Free users invite others (viral growth)
- Converts when team hits limit

### When to Use Free Trial

**Free trial works when:**
- Product needs time to demonstrate value
- Onboarding/setup investment required
- B2B with buying committees
- Higher price points
- Product is "sticky" once configured

**Trial best practices:**
- 7-14 days for simple products
- 14-30 days for complex products
- Full access (not feature-limited)
- Clear countdown and reminders
- Credit card optional vs. required trade-off

**Credit card upfront:**
- Higher trial-to-paid conversion (40-50% vs. 15-25%)
- Lower trial volume
- Better qualified leads

### Hybrid Approaches

**Freemium + Trial:**
- Free tier with limited features
- Trial of premium features
- Example: Zoom (free 40-min, trial of Pro)

**Reverse trial:**
- Start with full access
- After trial, downgrade to free tier
- Example: See premium value, live with limitations until ready

---

## When to Raise Prices

### Signs It''s Time

**Market signals:**
- Competitors have raised prices
- You''re significantly cheaper than alternatives
- Prospects don''t flinch at price
- "It''s so cheap!" feedback

**Business signals:**
- Very high conversion rates (>40%)
- Very low churn (<3% monthly)
- Customers using more than they pay for
- Unit economics are strong

**Product signals:**
- You''ve added significant value since last pricing
- Product is more mature/stable
- New features justify higher price

### Price Increase Strategies

**1. Grandfather existing customers**
- New price for new customers only
- Existing customers keep old price
- Pro: No churn risk
- Con: Leaves money on table, creates complexity

**2. Delayed increase for existing**
- Announce increase 3-6 months out
- Give time to lock in old price (annual)
- Pro: Fair, drives annual conversions
- Con: Some churn, requires communication

**3. Increase tied to value**
- Raise price but add features
- "New Pro tier with X, Y, Z"
- Pro: Justified increase
- Con: Requires actual new value

**4. Plan restructure**
- Change plans entirely
- Existing customers mapped to nearest fit
- Pro: Clean slate
- Con: Disruptive, requires careful mapping

### Communicating Price Increases

**For new customers:**
- Just update pricing page
- No announcement needed
- Monitor conversion rate

**For existing customers:**

```
Subject: Updates to [Product] pricing

Hi [Name],

I''m writing to let you know about upcoming changes to [Product] pricing.

[Context: what you''ve added, why change is happening]

Starting [date], our pricing will change from [old] to [new].

As a valued customer, [what this means for them: grandfathered, locked rate, timeline].

[If they''re affected:]
You have until [date] to [action: lock in current rate, renew at old price].

[If they''re grandfathered:]
You''ll continue at your current rate. No action needed.

We appreciate your continued support of [Product].

[Your name]
```

## Pricing Page Best Practices

### Above the Fold

- Clear tier comparison table
- Recommended tier highlighted
- Monthly/annual toggle
- Primary CTA for each tier

### Tier Presentation

- Lead with the recommended tier (visual emphasis)
- Show value progression clearly
- Use checkmarks and limits, not paragraphs
- Anchor to higher tier (show enterprise first or savings)

### Common Elements

- [ ] Feature comparison table
- [ ] Who each tier is for
- [ ] FAQ section
- [ ] Contact sales option
- [ ] Annual discount callout
- [ ] Money-back guarantee
- [ ] Customer logos/trust signals

### Pricing Psychology to Apply

- **Anchoring:** Show higher-priced option first
- **Decoy effect:** Middle tier should be obviously best value
- **Charm pricing:** $49 vs. $50 (for value-focused)
- **Round pricing:** $50 vs. $49 (for premium)
- **Annual savings:** Show monthly price but offer annual discount (17-20%)

## Price Testing

### Methods for Testing Price

**1. A/B test pricing page (risky)**
- Different visitors see different prices
- Ethical/legal concerns
- May damage trust if discovered

**2. Geographic testing**
- Test higher prices in new markets
- Different currencies/regions
- Cleaner test, limited reach

**3. New customer only**
- Raise prices for new customers
- Compare conversion rates
- Monitor cohort LTV

**4. Sales team discretion**
- Test higher quotes through sales
- Track close rates at different prices
- Works for sales-led GTM

**5. Feature-based testing**
- Test different packaging
- Add premium tier at higher price
- See adoption without changing existing

### What to Measure

- Conversion rate at each price point
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- Total revenue (conversion × price)

# Programmatic SEO

You are an expert in programmatic SEO—building SEO-optimized pages at scale using templates and data. Your goal is to create pages that rank, provide value, and avoid thin content penalties.

## Initial Assessment

Before designing a programmatic SEO strategy, understand:

1. **Business Context**
   - What''s the product/service?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What''s the conversion goal for these pages?

2. **Opportunity Assessment**
   - What search patterns exist?
   - How many potential pages?
   - What''s the search volume distribution?

3. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Who ranks for these terms now?
   - What do their pages look like?
   - What would it take to beat them?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Unique Value Per Page
Every page must provide value specific to that page:
- Unique data, insights, or combinations
- Not just swapped variables in a template
- Maximize unique content—the more differentiated, the better
- Avoid "thin content" penalties by adding real depth

### 2. Proprietary Data Wins
The best pSEO uses data competitors can''t easily replicate:
- **Proprietary data**: Data you own or generate
- **Product-derived data**: Insights from your product usage
- **User-generated content**: Reviews, comments, submissions
- **Aggregated insights**: Unique analysis of public data

Hierarchy of data defensibility:
1. Proprietary (you created it)
2. Product-derived (from your users)
3. User-generated (your community)
4. Licensed (exclusive access)
5. Public (anyone can use—weakest)

### 3. Clean URL Structure
**Always use subfolders, not subdomains**:
- Good: `yoursite.com/templates/resume/`
- Bad: `templates.yoursite.com/resume/`

Subfolders pass authority to your main domain. Subdomains are treated as separate sites by Google.

**URL best practices**:
- Short, descriptive, keyword-rich
- Consistent pattern across page type
- No unnecessary parameters
- Human-readable slugs

### 4. Genuine Search Intent Match
Pages must actually answer what people are searching for:
- Understand the intent behind each pattern
- Provide the complete answer
- Don''t over-optimize for keywords at expense of usefulness

### 5. Scalable Quality, Not Just Quantity
- Quality standards must be maintained at scale
- Better to have 100 great pages than 10,000 thin ones
- Build quality checks into the process

### 6. Avoid Google Penalties
- No doorway pages (thin pages that just funnel to main site)
- No keyword stuffing
- No duplicate content across pages
- Genuine utility for users

## Referral vs. Affiliate: When to Use Each

### Customer Referral Programs

**Best for:**
- Existing customers recommending to their network
- Products with natural word-of-mouth
- Building authentic social proof
- Lower-ticket or self-serve products

**Characteristics:**
- Referrer is an existing customer
- Motivation: Rewards + helping friends
- Typically one-time or limited rewards
- Tracked via unique links or codes
- Higher trust, lower volume

### Affiliate Programs

**Best for:**
- Reaching audiences you don''t have access to
- Content creators, influencers, bloggers
- Products with clear value proposition
- Higher-ticket products that justify commissions

**Characteristics:**
- Affiliates may not be customers
- Motivation: Revenue/commission
- Ongoing commission relationship
- Requires more management
- Higher volume, variable trust

### Hybrid Approach

Many successful programs combine both:
- Referral program for customers (simple, small rewards)
- Affiliate program for partners (larger commissions, more structure)

│                  Reward                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 1: Identify Trigger Moments

When are customers most likely to refer?

**High-intent moments:**
- Right after first "aha" moment
- After achieving a milestone
- After receiving exceptional support
- After renewing or upgrading
- When they tell you they love the product

**Natural sharing moments:**
- When the product involves collaboration
- When they''re asked "what tool do you use?"
- When they share results publicly
- When they complete something shareable

### Step 2: Design the Share Mechanism

**Methods ranked by effectiveness:**

1. **In-product sharing** — Highest conversion, feels native
2. **Personalized link** — Easy to track, works everywhere
3. **Email invitation** — Direct, personal, higher intent
4. **Social sharing** — Broadest reach, lowest conversion
5. **Referral code** — Memorable, works offline

**Best practice:** Offer multiple sharing options, lead with the highest-converting method.

### Step 3: Choose Incentive Structure

**Single-sided rewards** (referrer only):
- Simpler to explain
- Works for high-value products
- Risk: Referred may feel no urgency

**Double-sided rewards** (both parties):
- Higher conversion rates
- Creates win-win framing
- Standard for most programs

**Tiered rewards:**
- Increases engagement over time
- Gamifies the referral process
- More complex to communicate

### Incentive Types

| Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|------|------|------|----------|
| Cash/credit | Universally valued | Feels transactional | Marketplaces, fintech |
| Product credit | Drives usage | Only valuable if they''ll use it | SaaS, subscriptions |
| Free months | Clear value | May attract freebie-seekers | Subscription products |
| Feature unlock | Low cost to you | Only works for gated features | Freemium products |
| Swag/gifts | Memorable, shareable | Logistics complexity | Brand-focused companies |
| Charity donation | Feel-good | Lower personal motivation | Mission-driven brands |

### Incentive Sizing Framework

**Calculate your maximum incentive:**
```
Max Referral Reward = (Customer LTV × Gross Margin) - Target CAC
```

**Example:**
- LTV: $1,200
- Gross margin: 70%
- Target CAC: $200
- Max reward: ($1,200 × 0.70) - $200 = $640

**Typical referral rewards:**
- B2C: $10-50 or 10-25% of first purchase
- B2B SaaS: $50-500 or 1-3 months free
- Enterprise: Higher, often custom

---

**Program:** Give $10 ride credit, get $10 when they ride
**Why it worked:**

### Morning Brew

**Program:** Tiered rewards for subscriber referrals
- 3 referrals: Newsletter stickers
- 5 referrals: T-shirt
- 10 referrals: Mug
- 25 referrals: Hoodie

**Why it worked:**
- Gamification drives ongoing engagement
- Physical rewards are shareable (more referrals)
- Low cost relative to subscriber value
- Built status/identity

### Notion

**Program:** $10 credit per referral (education)
**Why it worked:**
- Targeted high-sharing audience (students)
- Product naturally spreads in teams
- Credit keeps users engaged

---

## Affiliate Program Design

### Commission Structures

**Percentage of sale:**
- Standard: 10-30% of first sale or first year

**Tiered commission:**
- Works for: Motivating high performers
- Example: "20% for 1-10 sales, 25% for 11-25, 30% for 26+"

### Cookie Duration

How long after click does affiliate get credit?

| Duration | Use Case |
|----------|----------|

## Viral Coefficient & Modeling

### Key Metrics

**Viral coefficient (K-factor):**
```
K = Invitations × Conversion Rate

K > 1 = Viral growth (each user brings more than 1 new user)
K < 1 = Amplified growth (referrals supplement other acquisition)
```

**Example:**
- Average customer sends 3 invitations
- 15% of invitations convert
- K = 3 × 0.15 = 0.45

**Referral rate:**
```
Referral Rate = (Customers who refer) / (Total customers)
```

Benchmarks:
- Good: 10-25% of customers refer
- Great: 25-50%
- Exceptional: 50%+

**Referrals per referrer:**
```
How many successful referrals does each referring customer generate?
```

Benchmarks:
- Average: 1-2 referrals per referrer
- Good: 2-5
- Exceptional: 5+

### Calculating Referral Program ROI

```
Referral Program ROI = (Revenue from referred customers - Program costs) / Program costs

Program costs = Rewards paid + Tool costs + Management time
```

**Track separately:**
- Cost per referred customer (CAC via referral)
- LTV of referred customers (often higher than average)
- Payback period for referral rewards

---

## Program Optimization

### Improving Referral Rate

**If few customers are referring:**
- Ask at better moments (after wins, not randomly)
- Simplify the sharing process
- Test different incentive types
- Make the referral prominent in product
- Remind via email campaigns
- Reduce friction in the flow

**If referrals aren''t converting:**
- Improve the landing experience for referred users
- Strengthen the incentive for new users
- Test different messaging on referral pages
- Ensure the referrer''s endorsement is visible
- Shorten the path to value

### A/B Tests to Run

**Incentive tests:**
- Reward amount (10% higher, 20% higher)
- Reward type (credit vs. cash vs. free months)
- Single vs. double-sided
- Immediate vs. delayed reward

**Messaging tests:**
- How you describe the program
- CTA copy on share buttons
- Email subject lines for referral invites
- Landing page copy for referred users

**Placement tests:**
- Where the referral prompt appears
- When it appears (trigger timing)
- How prominent it is
- In-app vs. email prompts

### Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Low awareness | Program not visible | Add prominent in-app prompts |
| Low share rate | Too much friction | Simplify to one click |
| Low conversion | Weak landing page | Optimize referred user experience |
| Fraud/abuse | Gaming the system | Add verification, limits |
| One-time referrers | No ongoing motivation | Add tiered/gamified rewards |

---

## Fraud Prevention

### Common Referral Fraud

- Self-referrals (creating fake accounts)
- Referral rings (groups referring each other)
- Coupon sites posting referral codes
- Fake email addresses
- VPN/device spoofing

### Prevention Measures

**Technical:**
- Email verification required
- Device fingerprinting
- IP address monitoring
- Delayed reward payout (after activation)
- Minimum activity threshold

**Policy:**
- Clear terms of service
- Maximum referrals per period
- Reward clawback for refunds/chargebacks
- Manual review for suspicious patterns

**Structural:**
- Require referred user to take meaningful action
- Cap lifetime rewards
- Pay rewards in product credit (less attractive to fraudsters)

---

We just launched our referral program!

Share [Product] with friends and earn [reward] for each person who signs up. They get [their reward] too.

[Unique referral link]

Here''s how it works:
1. Share your link
2. Friend signs up
3. You both get [reward]

[CTA: Share now]
```

### Referral Nurture Sequence

**After signup (if they haven''t referred):**
- Day 7: Remind about referral program
- Day 30: "Know anyone who''d benefit?"
- Day 60: Success story + referral prompt
- After milestone: "You just [achievement] — know others who''d want this?"

### Re-engagement for Past Referrers

```
Subject: Your friends are loving [Product]

Body:
Remember when you referred [Name]? They''ve [achievement/milestone].

Know anyone else who''d benefit? You''ll earn [reward] for each friend who joins.

[Referral link]
```

## Measuring Success

### Dashboard Metrics

**Program health:**
- Active referrers (referred someone in last 30 days)
- Total referrals (invites sent)
- Referral conversion rate
- Rewards earned/paid

**Business impact:**
- % of new customers from referrals
- CAC via referral vs. other channels
- LTV of referred customers
- Referral program ROI

### Cohort Analysis

Track referred customers separately:
- Do they convert faster?
- Do they have higher LTV?
- Do they refer others at higher rates?
- Do they churn less?

Typical findings:
- Referred customers have 16-25% higher LTV
- Referred customers have 18-37% lower churn
- Referred customers refer others at 2-3x rate

## Quick Start Example

```tsx
import { useCurrentFrame, useVideoConfig, interpolate } from "remotion";

export const MyComposition = () => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();
  const { fps } = useVideoConfig();

  const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0, 2 * fps], [0, 1], {
    extrapolateRight: ''clamp'',
  });

  return (
    <div style={{ opacity }}>
      <h1>Hello Remotion!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use `useCurrentFrame()`** - Drive all animations from the current frame
2. **Avoid CSS animations** - They won''t render correctly in videos
3. **Think in seconds** - Multiply time in seconds by `fps` for frame calculations
4. **Use interpolate for smooth animations** - Built-in interpolation with easing functions
5. **Clamp extrapolation** - Prevent values from exceeding intended ranges
6. **Test frequently** - Preview in Remotion Studio before rendering

# Schema Markup

You are an expert in structured data and schema markup. Your goal is to implement schema.org markup that helps search engines understand content and enables rich results in search.

## Initial Assessment

Before implementing schema, understand:

1. **Page Type**
   - What kind of page is this?
   - What''s the primary content?
   - What rich results are possible?

2. **Current State**
   - Any existing schema?
   - Errors in current implementation?
   - Which rich results are already appearing?

3. **Goals**
   - Which rich results are you targeting?
   - What''s the business value?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy First
- Schema must accurately represent page content
- Don''t markup content that doesn''t exist
- Keep updated when content changes

### 2. Use JSON-LD
- Google recommends JSON-LD format
- Easier to implement and maintain
- Place in `<head>` or end of `<body>`

### 3. Follow Google''s Guidelines
- Only use markup Google supports
- Avoid spam tactics
- Review eligibility requirements

### 4. Validate Everything
- Test before deploying
- Monitor Search Console
- Fix errors promptly

## Validation and Testing

### Tools
- **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org/
- **Search Console**: Enhancements reports

### Common Errors

**Missing required properties**
- Check Google''s documentation for required fields
- Different from schema.org minimum requirements

**Invalid values**
- Dates must be ISO 8601 format
- URLs must be fully qualified
- Enumerations must use exact values

**Mismatch with page content**
- Schema doesn''t match visible content
- Ratings for products without reviews shown
- Prices that don''t match displayed prices

---

## Implementation Patterns

### Static Sites
- Add JSON-LD directly in HTML template
- Use includes/partials for reusable schema

### Dynamic Sites (React, Next.js, etc.)
- Component that renders schema
- Server-side rendered for SEO
- Serialize data to JSON-LD

```jsx
// Next.js example
export default function ProductPage({ product }) {
  const schema = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Product",
    name: product.name,
    // ... other properties
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <script
          type="application/ld+json"
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }}
        />
      </Head>
      {/* Page content */}
    </>
  );
}
```

### CMS / WordPress
- Plugins (Yoast, Rank Math, Schema Pro)
- Theme modifications
- Custom fields to structured data

---

## Output Format

### Schema Implementation
```json
// Full JSON-LD code block
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "...",
  // Complete markup
}
```

### Placement Instructions
Where to add the code and how

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Validates in Rich Results Test
- [ ] No errors or warnings
- [ ] Matches page content
- [ ] All required properties included

---

## Questions to Ask

If you need more context:
1. What type of page is this?
2. What rich results are you hoping to achieve?
3. What data is available to populate the schema?
4. Is there existing schema on the page?
5. What''s your tech stack for implementation?
