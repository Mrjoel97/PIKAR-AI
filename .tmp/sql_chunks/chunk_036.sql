# Three.js Geometry

## Quick Start

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

// Built-in geometry
const box = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const sphere = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.5, 32, 32);
const plane = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10);

// Create mesh
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(box, material);
scene.add(mesh);
```

## Built-in Geometries

### Basic Shapes

```javascript
// Box - width, height, depth, widthSegments, heightSegments, depthSegments
new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1);

// Sphere - radius, widthSegments, heightSegments, phiStart, phiLength, thetaStart, thetaLength
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32, 0, Math.PI * 2, 0, Math.PI); // Full sphere
new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32, 0, Math.PI); // Hemisphere

// Plane - width, height, widthSegments, heightSegments
new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10, 1, 1);

// Circle - radius, segments, thetaStart, thetaLength
new THREE.CircleGeometry(1, 32);
new THREE.CircleGeometry(1, 32, 0, Math.PI); // Semicircle

// Cylinder - radiusTop, radiusBottom, height, radialSegments, heightSegments, openEnded
new THREE.CylinderGeometry(1, 1, 2, 32, 1, false);
new THREE.CylinderGeometry(0, 1, 2, 32); // Cone
new THREE.CylinderGeometry(1, 1, 2, 6); // Hexagonal prism

// Cone - radius, height, radialSegments, heightSegments, openEnded
new THREE.ConeGeometry(1, 2, 32, 1, false);

// Torus - radius, tube, radialSegments, tubularSegments, arc
new THREE.TorusGeometry(1, 0.4, 16, 100);

// TorusKnot - radius, tube, tubularSegments, radialSegments, p, q
new THREE.TorusKnotGeometry(1, 0.4, 100, 16, 2, 3);

// Ring - innerRadius, outerRadius, thetaSegments, phiSegments
new THREE.RingGeometry(0.5, 1, 32, 1);
```

### Advanced Shapes

```javascript
// Capsule - radius, length, capSegments, radialSegments
new THREE.CapsuleGeometry(0.5, 1, 4, 8);

// Dodecahedron - radius, detail
new THREE.DodecahedronGeometry(1, 0);

// Icosahedron - radius, detail (0 = 20 faces, higher = smoother)
new THREE.IcosahedronGeometry(1, 0);

// Octahedron - radius, detail
new THREE.OctahedronGeometry(1, 0);

// Tetrahedron - radius, detail
new THREE.TetrahedronGeometry(1, 0);

// Polyhedron - vertices, indices, radius, detail
const vertices = [1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1];
const indices = [2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 3, 1];
new THREE.PolyhedronGeometry(vertices, indices, 1, 0);
```

### Path-Based Shapes

```javascript
// Lathe - points[], segments, phiStart, phiLength
const points = [
  new THREE.Vector2(0, 0);
